With a long coastline and unique marine fish species, marine fishing could drive sustainable development in Africa. However, with increasing human-environmental challenges in tropical fishing zones, the projected sustainability benefits from Africa’s fisheries resources are threatened. This is worsened by the limited research to understand how these challenges have persisted or could be realigned to suit blue transformations in the marine fisheries sector. We sourced 1066 documents from Scopus, which were analyzed using bibliometrics to (i) analyze research trends and (ii) understand intricate networks and critical themes in research and policy regarding marine fisheries. Findings on research trends reveal a decline in research on marine fishing, domination of research by non-African authors, and institutions, and limited publications in reputable journals. Complex networks persist, worsened by the limited funding of transdisciplinary research. Most researchers and research institutions in Africa prefer marine fisheries science research. Limited marine sociological research has been conducted. Key themes are not prioritizing current governance pathways, and there is limited collaboration among coastal African countries, authors, and institutions in research. To build a new aura for sustainability, a Priority Action Pathway (PAP) has been developed that includes six (6) priority actions to drive sustainable transformations. With increased collaborations, focus on transdisciplinary marine fishing research and a shift in fisheries policy research emphasis to focus on the understanding of socioecological complexities, possibilities for identifying and promoting sustainability transformations (including in sustainable financing) in the sector are possible. This can be through an increased focus on collecting and integrating marine social science with marine fisheries science research. This can help identify/create novel perspectives from tropical coastal communities needed to co-design sustainable priority actions and mechanisms in coastal fishing zones. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Africa; Bibliometric Analysis; Coastal Resilience And Governance; Human-environmental Risks; Marine Fishing; Priority Action Pathway (pap); Small-scale Fisherfolks (ssfs); Vulnerable Coastal Zones,,,"African Union Agenda 2063 the Africa We Want, (2024); Auta, Helen Shnada, Distribution and importance of microplastics in the marine environmentA review of the sources, fate, effects, and potential solutions, Environment International, 102, pp. 165-176, (2017); Belhabib, Dyhia, Fisheries catch misreporting and its implications: The case of Senegal, Fisheries Research, 151, pp. 1-11, (2014); Belhabib, Dyhia, Impacts of anthropogenic and natural “extreme events” on global fisheries, Fish and Fisheries, 19, 6, pp. 1092-1109, (2018); Belhabib, Dyhia, Trends in Industrial and Artisanal Catch Per Effort in West African Fisheries, Conservation Letters, 11, 1, (2018); Borja, Angel, Innovative and practical tools for monitoring and assessing biodiversity status and impacts of multiple human pressures in marine systems, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 196, 8, (2024); Borja, Angel, Overview of integrative tools and methods in assessing ecological integrity in estuarine and coastal systems worldwide, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 56, 9, pp. 1519-1537, (2008); Borja, Angel, Good Environmental Status of marine ecosystems: What is it and how do we know when we have attained it?, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 76, 1-2, pp. 16-27, (2013); Tales from A Thousand and One Ways to Integrate Marine Ecosystem Components When Assessing the Environmental Status Bridging the Gap Between Policy and Science in Assessing the Health Status of Marine Ecosystems, (2017); Boyer, David C., An overview of the living marine resources of Namibia, South African Journal of Marine Science, 23, pp. 5-35, (2001)",,Springer Nature,,25614150,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218214037,

Despite their importance for global greenhouse gas emission pathways, a systematic assessment of ECAs’ role and financing patterns in the low-carbon energy transition is still needed. Using commercial transaction data, here we analyze 921 energy deals backed by ECAs from 31 OECD and non-OECD countries (excluding Canada) between 2013 and 2023. We find that while the share of renewables in global ECA energy commitments rose substantially between 2013 and 2023, ECAs remain heavily involved in the fossil fuel sector, with support varying substantially across technologies, value chain stages, and countries. Portfolio ‘greening’ is primarily driven by members of the E3F climate club, impacting deal financing structures and shifting finance flows towards high-income countries.

But it assumes the continued availability of advanced materials and technology. This paper argues that much of the degrowth literature implicitly or explicitly requires an industrial “core.” The paper introduces a stylized three-sector model with a formal convivial economy that predominates in everyday life, together with an industrial core and informal household convivial production. Drawing on prior work by post-Keynesian economists, which showed that positive net profit for the economy as a whole is compatible with a steady-state economy if there is consumption out of wealth, this paper shows that a wealth tax can play the same role and extends the result to a degrowth pathway. This has important policy implications because the viability of degrowth and a steady state no longer rely on a behavioral parameter alone, opening the way for functional finance. The paper presents an explicit balanced degrowth pathway, and then discusses more realistic degrowth pathways. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Classical Economics; Degrowth; Post-keynesian; Social Ecological Economics; Stock-flow Consistent; Financial System; Growth Rate; Industrial Ecology; Macroeconomics; Sustainability; Tax System,financial system; growth rate; industrial ecology; macroeconomics; sustainability; tax system,"The author is grateful to the four reviewers who carefully read and commented on the paper.

Rather than focusing solely on average ESG performance, we argue that inequality captures critical disparities that reveal structural barriers to adoption. To quantify these disparities, we employ the Gini index, and to explain them, we compare alternative machine learning models and simple Linear Regressions, evaluating their performance through residual analysis, including the calculation of the residual Gini indices. We apply this framework to a sample of over 1,000 Italian SMEs across various sectors. The findings reveal significant heterogeneity in ESG practices, with marked sectoral differences. This approach helps identifying where targeted policy interventions are most needed to promote more inclusive and balanced sustainable development among SMEs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg Factors; Inequality; Machine Learning Models,,"The paper is the result of a close collaboration between the three authors.

The comparison of empirical estimates shows that many studies project limited estimates of damages for banks. For both loan and bond spreads, most estimates of the effect of climate change are below 50 bp. In comparison, studies on stock markets document responses that are more substantial. In real estate markets, there is evidence of price effects notably for flood risks associated with sea level rise. However, some studies indicate that climate risks could be underestimated.

However, systematic analysis of its CF projects remains limited, raising key questions such as what qualifies as a CF project, how the Paris Agreement has influenced the Bank’s CF, and whether CF projects are directed to areas of greatest need. Utilizing statistical analysis and natural language processing, this study offers a novel examination of the Bank’s CF projects. To provide a nuanced and detailed picture, we uniquely distinguish between the Bank-financed “pure” CF projects—those dedicated exclusively to climate objectives—and “mixed” CF projects, which combine climate aims with other priorities. Although there has been a significant increase in the Bank’s CF post-Paris, this rise is primarily driven by mixed CF projects with low climate components. Furthermore, while vulnerable countries and large emitters have received more mixed CF projects following the Paris Agreement, they have not received more pure CF projects.

The lack of systematic tools to integrate climate adaptation into the planning and design processes for public real estate underscores the need for innovative assessment frameworks. This study introduces a novel climate assessment framework to support decision-making throughout the construction lifecycle – investment planning, design, and monitoring – by enabling the evaluation of AS IS and TO BE conditions of real estate assets, ensuring alignment with European regulations. Developed in collaboration with the Italian State Property Agency, it includes: (i) a pre-assessment tool to prioritize interventions during the investment planning based on climatic and non-climatic drivers; (ii) an assessment tool to quantify the vulnerability levels and adaptation goals during the design phase based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); (iii) guidelines to periodically monitor climate hazards and effectiveness of adaptation measures over time; and (iv) catalogue of adaptation measures categorized into grey (structural), green (nature-based), and blue (water-based) solutions. Drawing from European climate policies, Green Building Rating Systems, and Resilience Rating Systems, the framework identifies KPIs tailored to climate-related hazards and physical attributes of the real estate assets. The framework marks a significant advancement toward a systematic and replicable tool for integrating climate adaptation into real estate interventions, aligning with EU climate objectives and offering practical applications for public and private stakeholders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Building Life Cycle; Built Environment; Climate Change Adaptation; Key Performance Indicators; Public Real Estate; Rating Systems,,"The study was funded under the framework agreement for technical and scientific cooperation between the Italian State Property Agency and the CMCC Foundation , Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change ( project site ).","undefined, (2023); Adger, W.

Our findings reveal a strikingly low rate of climate change mitigation consideration, with only 13 % to 16 % of investing firms factoring these issues into their decisions. We found that firms investing in process innovation exhibit a 14.09 % higher probability of supporting energy adaptation and a 10.89 % higher likelihood of mitigating energy price impacts. While the overall consideration of climate change in investment decisions remains low, firms that do respond tend to focus on process innovation market development and plant, machinery and vehicles investments. These targeted investments may yield tangible impacts on reducing environmental footprints and energy price exposure, particularly in high energy use sectors. However, the narrow focus suggests that UK firms' capacity to significantly reduce their environmental impact may be constrained in the short term. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Climate Change; Energy Prices; Investment; Sustainability; Costs; Decision Making; Energy Utilization; Environmental Impact; Process Engineering; Adaptation; Climate Change Mitigation; Decision-making Process; Energy; Energy Prices; High Probability; In-process; Investment Decision Making; Low Rates; Process Innovation; Climate Change; Investments; Sustainable Development; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Energy Market; Investment; Sustainability; United Kingdom,Costs; Decision making; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Process engineering; Adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Decision-making process; Energy; Energy prices; High probability; In-process; Investment decision making; Low rates; Process Innovation; Climate change; Investments; Sustainable development; adaptive management; climate change; energy market; investment; sustainability; United Kingdom,"This work was supported by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), for the project \u201CUnderstanding how constraints on access to finance and under-investment impact on productivity growth in smaller firms\u201D (ES/W010259/1).

The bibliometric results reveal a sharp rise in scholarly output since 2020, driven by tighter sustainability regulations, growing investor scrutiny, and global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Performance analysis highlights that Europe and North America, particularly Italy and the United States, lead in research productivity and citation impact, although collaboration remains fragmented. Science mapping identifies seven dominant thematic clusters, ranging from ESG risk integration in finance, controversies, and governance linkages to emerging data-driven and machine learning methods, which align closely with six core themes synthesized from the SLR. The qualitative synthesis of 26 influential studies confirms that ESG risk is a financially material factor influencing firm performance, audit quality, credit risk, and investment returns, but also exposes persistent challenges such as inconsistent measurement, limited causal testing, and underexplored contexts outside developed markets. The combined insights underline the need for harmonized ESG risk indicators, dynamic causal modeling, explainable AI, and cross-country comparative research. By bridging bibliometric structure and qualitative depth, this study offers an integrated foundation to guide future ESG risk scholarship and support more resilient, sustainable financial decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Social Governance Risk; Esg Risk; Esg Risk Measurement; Esg-related Risk,,,"Adams, Carol A., Conceptualising the contemporary corporate value creation process, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 30, 4, pp. 906-931, (2017); Ahmed, Sarwar Uddin, Why banks should consider ESG risk factors in bank lending?, Banks and Bank Systems, 13, 3, pp. 71-80, (2018); Are Esg Ratings Informative about Companies Socially Responsible Behaviors Abroad Evidence from the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, (2025); Anselmi, Giulio, ESG ratings: Disagreement across providers and effects on stock returns, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 100, (2025); Asante-Appiah, Bright, Does the severity of a client's negative environmental, social and governance reputation affect audit effort and audit quality?, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 39, 3, (2020); Asante-Appiah, Bright, The role of the external auditor in managing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reputation risk, Review of Accounting Studies, 28, 4, pp. 2589-2641, (2023); Bang, Jeongseok, ESG controversy as a potential asset-pricing factor, Finance Research Letters, 58, (2023); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bax, Karoline, ESG, risk, and (tail) dependence, International Review of Financial Analysis, 87, (2023); Bénabou, Roland, Individual and corporate social responsibility, Economica, 77, 305, pp. 1-19, (2010)",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,25723170,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011154401,

The roles of three kinds of habitat remediation are sometimes confused. Here we set out to distinguish among and compare “third step remediation” (3SR), the third step in the mitigation hierarchy, end-of-project reclamation/rehabilitation, and offsetting. The essential criteria for 3SR to contribute to no net loss of biodiversity are quality, quantity and timeliness, the last emphasizing the need to address biodiversity losses in a compressed timeframe. Using these criteria, we distinguish 3SR from end-of-project rehabilitation/reclamation and from biodiversity offsetting, the fourth step of the mitigation hierarchy, and offsetting from end-of-project work. We briefly review two policies from Canada and Australia which unhelpfully blur these distinctions.

The World Energy Council (WEC) Energy Transition Index (ETI) is widely used (presently 126 countries) but reliability questions persist. Uncertainties (stochastic and ontic), including interdependencies and differentiated goals and values among nations, undermine reliability if not validity. Employing Šprajc et al.’s (2019) study as a methodological comparator, we deploy a more fine-grained analysis of the WEC ETI 2024 dataset, using PCA and Cronbach's Alpha to measure internal consistency and overall reliability. We find three primary factors as significant to transition: energy equity & governance, energy security, environmental sustainability, with country context dissolved. This represents a structural change to the ETI typology, and more internally consistent and reliable. Our results suggest policy makers re-evaluate how they use the ETI to inform policy decisions regarding energy transition. For example, our model draws attention to strong interdependencies among variables constituting energy equity & governance. Here, policy decisions must consider the effect of those decisions on CO2 emissions and the availability of uninterruptible energy supply. There is also a strong national security incentive of investing in energy efficiency (production and consumption). Further, developing diversity of energy sources includes taking a more sophisticated approach to using carbon-based energy rather than setting unrealistic goals for its total elimination. Missing from the WEC ETI is the need to take account of likely increased use of materials to support renewable energy strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Energy Security; Energy Transition Index; Index; Meta-uncertainty; Principal Component Analysis; Energy; Energy Equity; Energy Transition Index; Energy Transitions; Environmental Sustainability; Index; Meta-uncertainty; Principal-component Analysis; Uncertainty; World Energy Council; Energy Utilization,Energy; Energy equity; Energy transition index; Energy transitions; Environmental sustainability; Index; Meta-uncertainty; Principal-component analysis; Uncertainty; World Energy Council; Energy utilization,We are grateful to the World Energy Council for their cooperation in responding to our request for additional information on their Trilemma Index Tool.,"Blindsided how France and Germany Cleared the Way for Russia, (2023); Eu Coal Rebound Smaller than Feared in 2022 Energy Crunch, (2023); Europe S Messy Russian Gas Divorce, (2024); Global Energy Law and Sustainability, (2022); Farrell, Alexander E., Energy infrastructure and security, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 29, pp. 421-469, (2004); Russia Hits Ukraine Energy Infrastructure in Large Scale Missile Drone Attack; Consequences of Russias War on Ukraine for Climate Action Food Supply and Energy Security, (2023); European Parliamentary Research Service, (2023); Rawtani, Deepak, Environmental damages due to war in Ukraine: A perspective, Science of the Total Environment, 850, (2022); Chen, Yangyang, Impact assessment of energy sanctions in geo-conflict: Russian–Ukrainian war, Energy Reports, 9, pp. 3082-3095, (2023)",,Elsevier Ltd,,18790690; 13640321,,RSERF,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007081907,

This study applies the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development as a lens to review literature and investigate practices in Nordic banks on sustainability considerations in corporate credit risk assessment. Three gaps and recommendations are presented: (i) banks should apply a systems perspective that goes beyond a narrow focus on climate change to avoid sub-optimisation; (ii) strategies like inclusion and exclusion should be informed by backcasting from basic sustainability principles to foresee the long-term direction of change and to assess whether solutions are scalable towards sustainability; and (iii) instead of asking whether it ‘pays to be sustainable’, research and practice should focus on ‘how’ companies can work strategically with sustainability, finding the optimal timing between being too passive and too proactive. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Credit Risk Assessment; Esg; Risk Management; Strategic Sustainable Development; Sustainable Finance; Triple Bottom Line; Banking; Climate Change; Corporate Strategy; Credit Provision; Industrial Practice; Risk Assessment; Sustainable Development; Scandinavia,banking; climate change; corporate strategy; credit provision; industrial practice; risk assessment; sustainable development; Scandinavia,"Funding text 1: This work was funded by the Knowledge Foundation, Sweden, under Grant Number 20240015.

This study explores the potential of environmental liability insurance to promote sustainability by complementing traditional regulations. It argues that liability insurance incentivises the prevention of pollution and victim compensation through its compensation and governance functions. It presents the theoretical foundations of environmental insurance. It also demonstrates how insurance can facilitate the integration of environmental protection and economic growth. Besides, it analyses how insurers influence policyholders’behaviours through risk-based pricing, loss prevention, claim management and contract design, mitigating moral hazard. Evidence from China demonstrates that liability insurance effectively reduces emissions and promotes green innovation, but market development faces challenges such as adverse selection, limited liability rules and insolvency risks.

This study explores the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles within Saudi Arabia’s insurance sector, combining content analysis of corporate disclosures with qualitative insights from industry stakeholders. The research investigates how insurers embed ESG principles into their operations, the development of sustainable insurance products, and their perceived financial and regulatory implications. The findings reveal gradual progress in ESG integration, primarily driven by governance reforms aligned with national development agendas, while social and environmental dimensions remain comparatively underdeveloped. Stakeholders identify regulatory ambiguity, data limitations, and technical capacity as persistent barriers, but also point to increasing investor and consumer interest in sustainability-aligned offerings. This study offers policy and managerial recommendations to advance ESG principle adoption, emphasizing standardized disclosures, capacity-building, and product innovation.

Green insurance a concept is still not universally understood-takes the basic model of insurance and attempts to integrate sustainability principles into the practices of insuring and underwriting. This study investigates predictive analytics in green insurance, concentrating on how the exposure to climate risk sways the rates charged for insurance premiums. The research uses predictive analysis to lead toward better risk assessment and sustainable pricing decisions. The findings suggest that exposure to climate risk significantly boosts the rates of premium insurance, confirming that a greater climate risk leads to a higher cost of premiums. The results underscore that a commitment to sustainability serves as a partial buffer against the insurance premi-um.

Our review examines and compares the various strategies employed by key segments of this industry—namely institutional investors, asset managers, venture capital firms, insurers, and bond issuers—to foster a more sustainable economy. While our literature review reveals significant industry responses, it also highlights that the voluntary nature of many initiatives and the lack of standardized regulatory frameworks pose considerable challenges to transforming business models in line with sustainability goals.

ENRI sectors, including fossil fuels; cement and concrete; chemicals; metallic smelting; refining; and forming; metallic mineral mining; and pulp and paper mills, are exposed to significant climate-related risks due to their capital-intensive activities and long investment cycles. Our analysis confirms that ENRI firms identify and report more climate-related risks with higher estimated impacts compared to other firms in some risk categories, indicating higher awareness. However, ENRI firms tend to prioritise risks with high impact and high likelihood, and likely underestimate the uncertainty and financial impacts of climate-related risks, such as stranded assets. The study highlights the need for improved climate risk governance. Investors and voluntary disclosure initiatives should encourage firms to assess and report uncertain and high-impact risks, using explorative scenarios to overcome biases. Policymakers must enhance the credibility of climate policies by implementing comprehensive measures to support industrial transformation and stricter guidelines for climate-related risk disclosure. Understanding ENRI firms' perspectives on risks is crucial for informing policy and investment decisions to ensure alignment with net-zero targets. Future research should explore factors influencing risk perception, mitigation strategies, and business opportunities, and examine firms' processes for identifying and managing climate-related risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate-related Risk; Decarbonisation; Industrial Transformation; Transition Risk; Uncertainty,,"Funding text 1: This work was supported by FORMAS \u2013 The Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (grant number 2020-00195), Sparbanken Sk\u00E5ne Centre for Sustainable Enterprising (SSCEN) and by the V.

Through a narrative review of the literature, this paper examines how the emergence of forest on abandoned agricultural land in Nepal in response to out-migration, amongst other factors, could help to respond to the biodiversity and climate change crises by way of regenerative forestry. A critical analysis of the benefits and disadvantages of a wider acceptance of forest regeneration – or rewilding – in Nepal's middle hills is undertaken to present arguments for an alternative development pathway that could provide unique opportunities for innovative, yet resilient futures for biodiversity-rich developing countries like Nepal. While policy and research in Nepal has focussed on forestry, agriculture and rural livelihoods at local scales, beneficial outcomes from the regeneration of forest ecosystems on abandoned farmland are examined here at local, national and global scales, in association with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the recently adopted Global Biodiversity Framework. Multiple benefits are recognised from rewilding and reforestation, for landscape restoration, provisioning and regulating services. Income sources such as nature-based tourism and payments for ecosystem services now offer alternative financial mechanisms to improve environmental outcomes in transitioning landscapes while empowering communities connecting with nature. Yet, our analysis identified that livelihoods associated with forest succession – or rewilding – would need to be made resilient to local trade-offs, including food security, wildlife conflict and negative perceptions of reafforestation. Rewilding within developing countries will only be achieved via a broader acknowledgement of contemporary landscape change as an opportunity in association with targeted support at all levels – from global recognition for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation, to local livelihood support from agroforestry systems. To achieve a goal of revaluing forest regeneration in Nepal, policy would need to be adopted to sustainably oversee local transformations at a landscape scale. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Abandoned Land; Biodiversity Conservation; Nepal; Regenerating Forest; Rewilding; Sustainable Development Goals,,"Funding text 1: Peer reviewed literature to support and develop this analysis was sourced from databases Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. To enable a critical analysis, publications including terms such as \u2018rewild\u2019, \u2018reforest\u2019, \u2018natural regeneration\u2019 and \u2018forest succession\u2019 were searched for in the initial instance to provide a conceptual understanding of the term rewilding. The wealth of literature explored was not simply quantified in the review, but rather a summary of the evolution of the term is provided in relation to forest succession. Emerging themes that were subsequently examined included sustainable development, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services and human-wildlife conflict. Additionally, inter-governmental publications were referred to in broader discussions of ideas, while Nepalese governmental reports provided socio-ecological data in context of discussions.An alternative development pathway framed around the benefits of rewilding would require a more reflexive governance approach that anticipates and responds to forestation as an opportunity emerging from the changes in the broader SES. It would also require an international community to recognise that states such as Nepal in the Global South represent opportunities to facilitate socio-ecological transformations to support global SDGs and biodiversity targets, and that will need ongoing external support. Any successful approach would need to acknowledge that regeneration is influenced by land use practices at multiple levels of intervention, including recognising stages of forest succession as a transitioning pathway to alternative land-based livelihoods that could complement rather than compete with traditional agricultural practices. The limited capacity to integrate the unfolding and multi-scalar socio-ecological changes across the middle hills into reflexive policy suggests that time will be required to shift ideologies and facilitate adaptation across scales. Support for the local stewardship of the shifting environment could reconnect citizen networks with the transforming landscape, while mitigating many of the negative effects of the novel ecosystems. People's perceptions of the emerging wildness and how it impacts upon livelihoods and ecosystem services will be critical to any acceptance of rewilding initiatives (McGunnigle et al., 2025b; Perino et al., 2019). Cultural and institutional considerations currently present substantial barriers to any revaluation of forest regeneration, including the negative association of human-wildlife conflict with \u2018wild\u2019 terminology (McGunnigle et al., 2025a), but a renewed conversation on the values of rewilding has the potential to transform conceptions of the roles of forest regeneration in the middle hills of Nepal.Financial support was provided by Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research project, ACIAR FST/2017/037, \u201CEnhancing livelihoods from improved forest management in Nepal \u2013 EnLiFT2\"".A relationship with Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research project that includes funding grants and travel reimbursement.This work was supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research in conjunction with action research project EnLiFT2 (grant number FST/2017/037).The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Ian Nuberg reports financial support was provided by Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.

This paper first explains the relevant terms and their synonyms and moves on to define ESG issues and why they may be relevant in corporate distress scenarios. Next, it analyzes the existing international and European binding and soft-law regulatory framework related to ESG and insolvency law. The regulatory framework is the starting point for answering the question of whether ESG goals can be applied to corporate distress scenarios, and if so, how it can be accomplished in practice within the framework of the traditional objectives of pre-bankruptcy proceedings, bankruptcy with liquidation, and restructuring with a bankruptcy plan. Therefore, the central part of this paper assesses and critically analyzes the risks and opportunities that can arise from the introduction of ESG elements in corporate distress scenarios. The concluding section provides an overview of the status quo, with recommendations for future development. The authors conclude that the introduction of ESG elements in a distress scenartio is not always an option.

Yet the literature on sustainability disclosure offers little insight into how regulatory agendas change, instead focusing on how nongovernmental organizations drive voluntary disclosure. To address this deficiency, this paper charts how financial regulators came to embrace climate risk, analyzing how an array of non-state initiatives became coordinated in highlighting climate-related impairment risks. This coordination is conceptualized via scholarship on decentered regulation, allowing a first, theoretical, contribution by constructing and demonstrating one analytical approach to studying substantive change on sustainability. This paper draws on a 25-month participant observation of a United Nations standard-setting project, supported by semi-structured interviews. This allows a second, empirical, contribution by mapping how an accounting device, the so-called “carbon budget” (the maximum amount of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions that limits the probability of exceeding 2°C of warming to 20%), coordinated this array of non-state action toward resolving a core trade-off: if we burn our current fossil fuel reserves, we will exceed our warming targets. The paper then shows how these coordinated efforts pressured regulatory authorities to intervene on how finance affects and is affected by climate change. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Accounting; Civil Society; Climate Change; Decentered Regulation,,"I would like to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for allowing and facilitating the participant observation, as well as all the interviewees who participated in the fieldwork.

More analysis is needed of how NbS could be supported by economy-wide policies and financing sources other than carbon markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Emission Control; Environmental Economics; Land Use Change,carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental economics; land use change,,"Aldy, Joseph E., The Evolving Role of Greenhouse Gas Emission Offsets in Combating Climate Change, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 18, 2, pp. 212-233, (2024); Ando, Amy Whritenour, The Economics of Species Conservation, Annual Review of Resource Economics, 10, pp. 445-467, (2018); Angelsen, Arild, Environmental Income and Rural Livelihoods: A Global-Comparative Analysis, World Development, 64, S1, pp. S12-S28, (2014); Arriagada, Rodrigo A., Do payments pay off?

This review paper puts under scrutiny the environmental management practices and green materials and technologies adoption in the construction industries of two developed regions, Hong Kong and the UK, the main objective being to compare their approaches to construction waste management and assess the level to which they have adopted sustainable practices. This review recognizes construction waste as a major contributor to environmental degradation and indicates the on-site waste reduction according to waste hierarchy as adopted by both regions. Major findings are that effective environmental management practices, such as resource optimization, waste minimization, and pollution prevention, are also enforced through legislation and fiscal policies. The use of eco-concrete, plastic wood, and recycled steel, together with high-tech roofs and solar panels, shows a move toward sustainable and energy-saving building that is taking root more and more. This paper highlights the need for policies and innovation in promoting sustainable building. Future studies should look into the green techs’ long-term performance, cross-area policy spread, and how digital tools help maximize waste and create sustainably. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Construction; Developed Country; Environmental Management Practices; Green Materials; Green Materials Technology; Hong Kong; Uk,,,"Alaloul, Wesam Salah, Construction sector contribution to economic stability: Malaysian gdp distribution, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 9, (2021); Hatem, Zaid Mohammed, A New Perspective on the Relationship Between the Construction Industry Performance and The Economy Outcome-A Literature Review, Jurnal Kejuruteraan, 34, 2, pp. 191-200, (2022); International Conference on Education Technology and Management Science Icetms 2013, (2013); Norouzi, Masoud, Circular economy in the building and construction sector: A scientific evolution analysis, Journal of Building Engineering, 44, (2021); J Technol Manage Bus, (2022); Finnveden, Göran, Policy instruments towards a sustainable waste management, Sustainability, 5, 3, pp. 841-881, (2013); Cheng, Cuicui, Sustainable Environmental Management Through a Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme: A Hong Kong Perspective, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 10, (2022); Jia, Andrea Y., Modular integrated construction as a development strategy for post-COVID urban sustainability: the case of Hong Kong, Frontiers in Sustainable Cities, 7, (2025); Bao, Zhikang, Implementing on-site construction waste recycling in Hong Kong: Barriers and facilitators, Science of the Total Environment, 747, (2020); Evangelinos, Konstantinos I., Environmental management practices and engineering science: a review and typology for future research., Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management, 10, 2, pp. 153-162, (2014)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,24138851,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009083917,

However, in most developing countries, ESG risk models for mortgage lenders are very limited. In most of these countries, ESG-rating providers employ widely varying methodologies and disclosure policies, often resulting in divergent assessments of the same organization. This research develops a pilot statistical-analysis, dual-horizon ESG risk model specific to the Mexican mortgage industry, which provides a better understanding of how ESG risk could evolve over time across financial, operational, regulatory, and reputational dimensions in Mexico. This dual-horizon ESG framework considers a two-year short-term risk assessment and a ten-year long-term risk assessment. This research integrates expert opinions with a scoring system that improves on traditional methods. Dependability and internal consistency are tested using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach’s alpha. Radar chart visualization and cluster analysis are used to visualize the empirical results. The empirical findings show that environmental risk has strong temporal effects, and the perceived severity is 20% higher over the longer time horizon. Furthermore, social risk exhibits high variability, identifying it as a critical risk for financial stability and regulatory compliance. Cluster analysis identifies systematic patterns in expert opinions that determine two groups, making the qualitative findings derived from radar plots more robust. Group 0 (75% of experts) has an institutional view about ESG risks. Group 1 (25% of experts) aligns with an affiliation to large financial institutions. Finally, this research identifies three key sustainability challenges for the mortgage sector in Mexico: exposure to climate-induced stress, fragmented regulatory frameworks, and social inequality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Clustering; Esg Criteria; Mortgage Institutions; Radar Plots; Risk Management; Cluster Analysis; Correlation; Decision Making; Environmental Risk; Risk Assessment; Survey Method; Visualization; Mexico [north America],cluster analysis; correlation; decision making; environmental risk; risk assessment; survey method; visualization; Mexico [North America],"This research was funded by Instituto Polit\u00E9cnico Nacional, grant number: SIP-20252372-20250756-20254346, and was registered by Secretar\u00EDa de Investigaci\u00F3n y Posgrado, Instituto Polit\u00E9cnico Nacional.","la Torre, Mario, Does the ESG index affect stock return?

We identify the main current areas and dynamics of biodiversity accounting. Therefore, we explore how stakeholder capitalism can contribute to corporate commitments to biodiversity conservation. We also examine how the institutional context plays a role in these commitments. Finally, we analyze how these factors can contribute to global governance to achieve SDGs 14 and 15. We used a mixed-methods analysis by research synthesis. A bibliometric analysis was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) protocol to search and select scientific contributions to be analyzed. Citation analysis is used to map current research fronts. In addition, a bibliographic coupling is performed to identify connection networks in the current literature. We review a sample of 163 studies from the Academic Journal Guide (AJG). We identify research activities on biodiversity accounting between 1993 and early 2023. We used BibExcel and Gephi software packages to perform a scientific mapping analysis based on co-word bibliographic networks. The R package Bibliometrix is used to perform an algorithmic historiography. The empirical results show the current state of the art on biodiversity accounting and suggest new research trends. Our results are also intuitive, as biodiversity conservation accounting is undoubtedly at the center of global policy discussions. We find from this meta-analysis that differences in biodiversity accounting practices are due to the wide variety of institutions that have become entrenched over time. This article enriches the current state of the art. It also identifies important themes in the biodiversity accounting literature. This offers valuable theoretical and practical perspectives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bibliometric Analysis; Biodiversity Accounting; Biodiversity Conservation; Biodiversity Regulations; Institutional Context; Stakeholder Capitalism; Systematic Literature Review,,Funding text 1: This work was supported by King Khaled University.

Using a sample of 671 listed worldwide banks from 63 countries in 2010–2021, we demonstrate that green strategies and CSR committees positively affect all three circular economy targets. However, board gender diversity positively impacts bank emission reduction and green products offered but does not influence e-waste reduction.

At the same time, there is widespread confusion about how to best measure climate transition risk, since different measurements lead to significantly different risk profiles. I show empirically that, to date, the two most common proxies for climate transition risk are CO<inf>2</inf> and E(SG) score data. I further contribute to the transition risk literature by proposing a comprehensive 10-category framework, specifically tailored toward assessing climate transition risk proxies. I apply the framework by executing the first category-led literature review on the quality of both CO<inf>2</inf> data and E-scores as proxies for climate transition risk. I find that both data types are dynamic and strong in terms of granularity as well as usability; but have shortcomings across a multitude of categories: bias, availability, comparability, the backward-looking nature of the metrics, and transition risk specificity being the most severe issues. I urge scholars to reflect on these shortcomings as they could significantly distort results. As a minimum, scholars should test for the robustness of their results when relying solely on ESG or CO<inf>2</inf> data to classify transition risk. Therefore, I propose both within and between transition risk metric robustness tests, which are not yet commonly used in the literature. I close by introducing and discussing alternative proxies for climate transition risk, such as EU taxonomy alignment, sector/technology classifications, or innovative combinations of risk metrics. I argue that scholars should consider these alternatives since they are potentially less biased, more specific to transition risk, comparable, and available. I thereby contribute to a better measurement of companies' transition risk, which is a key prerequisite for accurately managing and correctly pricing climate transition risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Disclosure; Climate Transition Risk; Co2 Emissions; Esg Scores; Eu Taxonomy Alignment,,This study was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (Grant 01UU2205A).

The main findings show that BAB’s green credit portfolio grew significantly from 2021 to 2023, especially in agriculture, indicating a strong institutional commitment to sustainability. The bank also developed innovative green deposit products and digital banking services to reduce its ecological footprint. Despite this progress, key challenges persist, including limited access to long-term funding, insufficient staff expertise, and underdeveloped ESG data systems. The policy recommendations are: to strengthen regulatory support, enhance internal capacity, and diversify green financial products to scale sustainable finance in Vietnam. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bac A Bank; Green Banking; Practice; Vietnam; Banking; Green Economy; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; Viet Nam,banking; green economy; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; sustainability; Viet Nam,,"Mapping of Green Finance Delivered by Idfc Members in 2011, (2012); New Microfinance Handbook A Financial Market System Perspective, (2013); Definition of Green Finance, (2014); Principles for Responsible Banking, (2019); Sustainable Banking and Esg in Southeast Asia, (2021); Rehman, Alam, Adoption of green banking practices and environmental performance in Pakistan: a demonstration of structural equation modelling, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 23, 9, pp. 13200-13220, (2021); Xu, Xinkuo, Asymmetric impacts of the policy and development of green credit on the debt financing cost and maturity of different types of enterprises in China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 264, (2020); Khatun, Most Nilufa, Green Banking and Sustainable Development in Bangladesh, Sustainability and Climate Change, 14, 5, pp. 262-271, (2021); Zhang, Shengling, How does the green credit policy affect the technological innovation of enterprises?

In light of the International Maritime Organization’s emission reduction targets, transparent and effective Environmental and Social (E&S) reporting has become increasingly vital. This study critically examines current E&S reporting practices in the port industry through an analysis of recent disclosures from major European and global ports, supported by a review of academic and industry literature. The research explores how sustainability reports address key themes such as CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, energy efficiency, health and safety, operational performance, and biodiversity. While the presence of numerous indicators reflects a commitment to comprehensive sustainability, the proliferation of metrics poses challenges for clarity, comparability, and stakeholder engagement. The abundance of data risks diluting focus, complicating benchmarking, and may even contribute to greenwashing. Without standardization and strategic alignment, reporting can become counterproductive. This study advocates for a harmonized set of performance indicators that remain flexible enough to reflect port-specific strategies, yet are consistent with global benchmarks. Achieving this balance will require collaboration among researchers, industry leaders, and policymakers to develop transparent, adaptive E&S reporting frameworks that support meaningful progress in ports’ sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Performance Indicators (epis); Environmental, Social, And Governance (esg); Key Performance Indicators (kpis); Performance Indicators (pis); Port Sustainability; Sustainability Reporting; Performance Assessment; Policy Making; Port; Stakeholder; Standardization; Sustainability",performance assessment; policy making; port; stakeholder; standardization; sustainability,"Thanks are due to the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for the financial support to UID Centro de Estudos do Ambiente e Mar (CESAM) + LA/P/0094/2020, through national funds.","Chen, Jihong, Constructing governance framework of a green and smart port, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 7, 4, (2019); Joung, Taehwan, The IMO initial strategy for reducing Greenhouse Gas(GHG) emissions, and its follow-up actions towards 2050, Journal of International Maritime Safety, Environmental Affairs, and Shipping, 4, 1, pp. 1-7, (2020); undefined; Kluza, Krzysztof, Innovation and environmental, social, and governance factors influencing sustainable business models - Meta-analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 303, (2021); A Joint Report by the Asset Management Working Group of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and Mercer Demystifying Responsible Investment Performance A Review of Key Academic and Broker Research on Esg Factors, (2010); Martínez-Ferrero, Jennifer, The nonlinear relation between institutional ownership and environmental, social and governance performance in emerging countries, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 3, pp. 1-16, (2021); Cheon, SangHyun, The Economic–Social Performance Relationships of Ports: Roles of Stakeholders and Organizational Tension, Sustainable Development, 25, 1, pp. 50-62, (2017); An Analysis of the Sustainability Reports of 1000 Companies Pursuant to the Eu Non Financial Reporting Directive, (2019); undefined; undefined, (2023)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,20711050,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006711650,

Using a European panel dataset, the study includes a sample of the 30 most relevant European insurance companies listed in the stock exchange index Stoxx Europe 600 index, over the period 2016–2020. Main findings indicate that older insurance companies, with a larger dimension and profitability, less leveraged, with smaller boards, but with more gender diverse boards, with a sustainability committee and with a standalone sustainability report, tend to present a higher level of ESG performance. Findings also indicate that insurance companies with higher ESG performance are located in countries with higher gross domestic product growth rate.

The research focuses on the possibility of implementing circular economy (CE) concepts in the field of real estate development, as well as strategies to be incorporated. Annually, building construction demands 40% of raw materials, 25% virgin wood, 40% of energy, and 16% of water worldwide. Unlike the outmoded linear economy, the concept of CE insists on resource efficiency throughout a building’s life cycle, from design and manufacture to consumption, management of waste, and lessening natural capital loss and environmental pollution. This research applies an inclusive approach, including literature reviews and case studies, to examine the challenges and effective strategies for CE adoption in the Real Estate sector. The study outlines numerous CE techniques for real estate, including design, planning, building, operation, maintenance, and end-of-life. The study also focuses on the Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) as a tool to pinpoint environmental impact throughout the building’s Lifespan. Architects, Project Developers, Contractors, etc., can make decisions on the principles of design and alternatives for end-of-life that lessen the ecological impact. By reviving the environment throughout construction and operations, the CE approach is being used to improve financial performance for real estate investors and construction customers.

Agroforestry systems (AFS), integrating trees with crops and/or livestock, offer a promising pathway by synergistically enhancing food production, ecological stability, and public health outcomes. However, realizing this potential is hindered by gaps in understanding the complex interactions and trade-offs between these domains, limiting policy and practice effectiveness. This comprehensive review aimed to synthesize current evidence on how agroforestry integrates food security, public health, and environmental sustainability and to identify critical research gaps that limit its widespread adoption and optimization. Following the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, a systematic literature search was conducted across Web of Science and Scopus, with thematic analysis using VosViewer and quantitative synthesis of key metrics. The review confirms agroforestry’s multifaceted benefits, including enhanced dietary diversity, improved micronutrient intake (e.g., 18% reduction in vitamin A deficiency), significant carbon sequestration (0.5–2 Mg C/ha/year), soil health improvements (50–70% less erosion), income generation (+40%), and climate resilience (2–5 °C cooling). Key gaps identified include the need for longitudinal health studies, better quantification of climate–health interactions and non-material benefits, policy–health integration strategies, and analyses of economic–nutritional trade-offs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agroforestry; Climate Resilience; Environmental Sustainability; Food Security; Nutritional Health; Public Health; Smallholder Farmers; Agroforestry; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Dietary Intake; Food Security; Nutrition; Public Health; Smallholder; Soil Erosion; Sustainability; Trace Element; Vitamin Deficiency; Agricultural Worker; Benchmarking; Climate Resilience; Environmental Sustainability; Food Industry; Food Insecurity; Health Care Policy; Human; Livestock; Malnutrition; Micronutrient Intake; Nutritional Health; Retinol Deficiency; Review; Soil Health; Systematic Review; Thematic Analysis; Agriculture; Environmental Protection; Forestry; Procedures; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Food Security; Forestry; Humans; Public Health,agroforestry; carbon sequestration; climate change; dietary intake; food security; nutrition; public health; smallholder; soil erosion; sustainability; trace element; vitamin deficiency; agricultural worker; benchmarking; climate resilience; environmental sustainability; food industry; food insecurity; health care policy; human; livestock; malnutrition; micronutrient intake; nutritional health; retinol deficiency; Review; soil health; systematic review; thematic analysis; agriculture; environmental protection; forestry; procedures; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Food Security; Forestry; Humans; Public Health,,"State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023, (2023); Making Agrifood Systems More Resilient to Shocks and Stresses, (2021); Food Energy Secur, (2024); Fanzo, Jessica C., The effect of climate change across food systems: Implications for nutrition outcomes, Global Food Security, 18, pp. 12-19, (2018); Vermeulen, Sonja J., Climate change, agriculture and food security: A global partnership to link research and action for low-income agricultural producers and consumers, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 4, 1, pp. 128-133, (2012); Agroforestry for Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture in Asia and Africa, (2023); Jose, Shibu, Agroforestry for ecosystem services and environmental benefits: An overview, Agroforestry Systems, 76, 1, pp. 1-10, (2009); Kwesiga, Freddie R., Agroforestry research and development in southern Africa during the 1990s: Review and challenges ahead, Agroforestry Systems, 59, 3, pp. 173-186, (2003); Food Security and Nutrition Building A Global Narrative Towards 2030, (2020); Castle, Sarah E., Evidence for the impacts of agroforestry on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being in high-income countries: A systematic map protocol, Environmental Evidence, 7, 1, (2018)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,16604601; 16617827,,,40283866.0,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003394157,

This legislation abounds with direct and indirect references to human rights and business and human rights (BHR) frameworks like the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). They provide for BHR disclosure obligations and conduct obligations for investors and their portfolio entities. However, these references have largely been overlooked by both the BHR and financial law communities, leading to important gaps in how investors understand their BHR obligations and the efforts required to implement them. This article makes two contributions to understanding the integration of human rights in EU sustainable finance. First, it conducts a review of the extensive human right provisions in EU sustainable finance-related legislation, including the CSDDD, SFDR, Taxonomy Regulation, and CSRD. It also examines their mobilization of established administrative and sanction mechanisms to monitor and enforce compliance. Second, it highlights important challenges arising from this integration, particularly concerning coherence and terminology. Coherence challenges stem from conflicting interpretations between EU sustainable finance-related legislation, and between EU legislation and international human rights and BHR frameworks. Terminological challenges arise from different understandings of key concepts, such as 'risk', between the BHR and financial law communities.

Examining the rapid growth of ICG from an institutional political economy perspective, we argue that powerful financial and regulatory actors with varied interests coalesced to promote the discourse that climate risks equal financial risks, and to develop a finance-centered mechanism of climate governance. The flourishing field created market opportunities for other actors such as data vendors and accountants, and attracted activists seeking leverage on emitters. In turn, institutionalization exerted isomorphic pressure on financial firms to adopt ICG practices. However, ICG practices of disclosure and emission commitments became increasingly decoupled from actions to reduce emissions due to the weak business case for decarbonizing investors' portfolios and corporate operations; the core economic mechanism was largely a myth. This decoupling created contradictory forces: it erodes the legitimacy of the ICG discourse, but we also identified dynamic feedback loops that strengthen the field, potentially making the myth self-fulfilling. Overall, we conclude that the field's momentum, interests of key actors, and feedback effects are likely to sustain the field, which is deeply institutionalized despite the current headwinds. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate; Esg; Finance; Governance; Institutions; Political Economy; Sustainability,,Funding: This research was supported by Grant No 0610218182 from the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) and The Climate Social Science Network.,"Azar, José A., The Big Three and corporate carbon emissions around the world, Journal of Financial Economics, 142, 2, pp. 674-696, (2021); Baines, Joseph, From passive owners to planet savers?

Although compelling, prior studies demonstrate that firms can symbolically commit to climate and environmental disclosures yet not undertake action. Neo-institutional theory (NIT) suggests that two strategies exist: the legitimacy perspective, which manifests in symbolic efforts, and the efficiency perspective, which is more consistent with substantive efforts. In this article, we apply NIT to assess the climate transition efforts in large, publicly traded firms in five countries with similar regulatory and economic profiles (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). We gauge climate efforts by membership in corporate climate initiatives (CCIs) and the integration of climate action plans (CAPs). Of the eight CCIs and three CAPs investigated, we find that only two CCIs and one CAP help to improve emissions performance. The majority of firms in our sample, therefore, demonstrate the legitimacy perspective of NIT. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Governance; Climate Initiatives; Emissions Performance; Sample Selection; Tcfd,,,"Academy of Management Journal, (1979); Aguilera, Ruth, Putting the s back in corporate social responsibility: A multilevel theory of social change in organizations, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 836-863, (2007); Aragón-Correa, Juan Alberto Alberto, Strategic proactivity and firm approach to the natural environment, Academy of Management Journal, 41, 5, pp. 556-567, (1998); Organization Science, (1990); Backman, Charles A., The Drivers of Corporate Climate Change Strategies and Public Policy: A New Resource-Based View Perspective, Business and Society, 56, 4, pp. 545-575, (2017); Bäckstrand, Karin, Accountability of networked climate governance: The rise of transnational climate partnerships, Global Environmental Politics, 8, 3, pp. 74-102, (2008); Battiston, Stefano, A climate stress-test of the financial system, Nature Climate Change, 7, 4, pp. 283-288, (2017); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2019); Berliner, Daniel, Bluewashing"" the firm?

We utilize a unique data set of US equity mutual fund holdings between 2012 and 2021 to calculate the funds’ carbon footprints. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that, following their commitments to sustainability, environmental funds fail to reduce their carbon footprints relative to a matched group of conventional funds. We also find, using an event study, a significant increase in the flows of environmental funds in response to these commitments. The combination of the failure to reduce carbon footprints and the surge in inflows provides evidence of greenwashing by environmental funds, raising concerns about their fiduciary duty. Our findings also show that greenwashers tend to initially have low flows and high portfolio carbon emissions suggesting that they announce their commitments to sustainability just to attract investors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Footprint; Decarbonization; Environmental Funds; Fiduciary Duty; Fund Prospectus; Greenwashing,,The first author acknowledges financial support from the University of Southampton.,"Do Mutual Funds Keep their Promises, (2022); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Alok, Shashwat, Do fund managers misestimate climatic disaster risk, Review of Financial Studies, 33, 3, pp. 1146-1183, (2020); Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); Andersson, Mats, Hedging climate risk, Financial Analysts Journal, 72, 3, pp. 13-32, (2016); Discretionary Information in Esg Investing A Text Analysis of Mutual Fund Prospectuses, (2025); Aswani, Jitendra, Are Carbon Emissions Associated with Stock Returns?, Review of Finance, 28, 1, pp. 75-106, (2024); Avramov, Doron, Sustainable investing with ESG rating uncertainty, Journal of Financial Economics, 145, 2, pp. 642-664, (2022); Baker, Andrew C., How much should we trust staggered difference-in-differences estimates?, Journal of Financial Economics, 144, 2, pp. 370-395, (2022); Ben-David, Itzhak, What Do Mutual Fund Investors Really Care About?, Review of Financial Studies, 35, 4, pp. 1723-1774, (2022)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,01674544; 15730697,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001543330,

Its goal is to evaluate their utility in guiding financial decision-making within the real estate industry. Whilst climate risk has become a pivotal consideration in transaction and regulatory compliance, the existing tools for risk quantification frequently encounter criticism for their perceived lack of transparency and comparability. Design/methodology/approach: We utilise a sequential exploratory mixed-methods analysis to integrate qualitative aspects of underlying tool characteristics with quantitative result divergence. In our qualitative analysis, we conduct interviews with companies providing risk quantification tools. We task these providers with quantifying the physical risk of a fictive pan-European real estate portfolio. Our approach involves an in-depth comparative analysis, hypothesis tests and regression to discern patterns in the variability of the results. Findings: We observe significant variations in the quantification of physical risk for the pan-European portfolio, indicating limited utility for decision-making. The results highlight that variability is influenced by both the location of assets and the hazard. Identified reasons for discrepancies include differences in regional databases and models, variations in downscaling and corresponding scope, disparities in the definition of scores and systematic uncertainties. Practical implications: The study assists market participants in comprehending both the quantification process and the implications associated with using tools for financial decision-making. Originality/value: To our knowledge, this study presents the initial robust empirical evidence of variability in quantification outputs for physical risk within the real estate industry, coupled with an exploration of their underlying reasons. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Financial Decision-making; Physical Climate Risk; Quantification Tools,,,"Arribas, Alberto, Climate risk assessment needs urgent improvement, Nature Communications, 13, 1, (2022); Askelson, Natoshia M., Using predicted marginal effects to assess the impact of rurality and free and reduced lunch eligibility on a school-based nutrition intervention, Evaluation and Program Planning, 92, (2022); Phalanx, (2017); Berman, Matthew D., Adaptation to climate change in coastal communities: findings from seven sites on four continents, Climatic Change, 159, 1, pp. 1-16, (2020); Bernstein, Asaf, Disaster on the horizon: The price effect of sea level rise, Journal of Financial Economics, 134, 2, pp. 253-272, (2019); Bin, Okmyung, Measuring the impact of sea-level rise on coastal real estate: A hedonic property model approach, Journal of Regional Science, 51, 4, pp. 751-767, (2011); Transition Versus Physical Climate Risk Pricing in European Financial Markets A Text Based Approach, (2022); Burton, Alexander L., OLS (Linear) Regression, pp. 509-514, (2021); Cajias, Marcelo, Tearing down the information barrier: the price impacts of energy efficiency ratings for buildings in the German rental market, Energy Research and Social Science, 47, pp. 177-191, (2019); Unepfi, (2022)",,Emerald Publishing,,1463578X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001072618,

The study not only offers insights into the interplay of sustainable practices but also sheds light on the internal struggles within the banking sector to integrate environmental, social, and governance practices into daily operations. The findings reveal that the main topics related to banking sustainability are sustainability reporting, banking performance, and customer loyalty. Additionally, the research examines the definitions of essential constructs, such as sustainable banking and finance, green banking and finance, exploring overlaps and distinctive characteristics.

Spillover risk emerges from the introduction of energy decarbonization policies by Indonesia's main trading partners, such as China. Spillover risk is modeled as a demand shock for Indonesia's fossil fuels that affects its exports, building on the Network for Greening the Financial System's scenarios. By tailoring the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent model, we quantify the impact of spillover risk on the Indonesian economy, on the sovereign fiscal and financial dimensions. We find that spillover risk weakens the Indonesian balance of payment, leading to indirect and cascading effects on public finance and public debt, which increases by up to 23 percent of GDP by 2050. Thus, potential trade-offs between energy decarbonization and sovereign financial stability could emerge, along with the materialization of carbon-stranded assets. Our results highlight the importance of coordinated climate policy introduction. They also bring out the importance to include spillover risks in the climate financial risk monitoring and assessment programs of national and international supervisory authorities (e.g. the Debt Sustainability Analyses and Financial Stability Assessment Programmes of the International Monetary Fund) for better risk management and climate policy design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Balance Of Payment; Climate Transition Spillover Risks; Fossil Fuels; Network For Greening The Financial System Scenarios; Sovereign Risk; Stock-flow Consistent Model; Balance Of Payment; Climate Transition; Climate Transition Spillover Risk; Financial System; Indonesia; Network For Greening The Financial System Scenario; Sovereign Risks; Stock Flows; Stock-flow Consistent Model; System Scenarios; Decentralized Finance; Balance Of Payments; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Energy Policy; Environmental Policy; Export; Financial System; Fossil Fuel; Sovereignty; Spillover Effect; Trade-off,Balance of payment; Climate transition; Climate transition spillover risk; Financial system; Indonesia; Network for greening the financial system scenario; Sovereign risks; Stock flows; Stock-flow consistent model; System scenarios; Decentralized finance; balance of payments; carbon emission; climate change; energy policy; environmental policy; export; financial system; fossil fuel; sovereignty; spillover effect; trade-off,"Funding text 1: RG and IM acknowledge the financial support of Boston University\u2019s Global Development Policy Center Task on Climate Policy for Development at the International Monetary Fund, and of the Erasmus+/Knowledge Alliance project [GrEnFin, grant number 612408-EPP-1-2019-1-EPPKA2-KA ].

(Un)surprisingly, limited research has been done on how WE in the BE can be achieved. 158 documents are reviewed and participatory engagements with 58 coastal women in Alappad are conducted, to (i) understand the current landscape of the BE and WE and (ii) gain evidence-based perspectives that can drive WE. Findings revealed that the global south has unique BE endowments and comparative advantages for WE and ocean sustainability. Long-established BE sectors where women have historically participated present better opportunities for WE. WE in the BE could increase profits from ocean-based sectors to US$22 trillion by 2050. These can be scaled up to emerging BE sectors, e.g., renewable energy. However, complex WE dynamics persist. The socio-economic benefits women get from coastal sectors are low. Women's participation in BE sectors has not translated into holistic WE. Livelihood survival pressures have increased due to human-environmental threats. Socioeconomic impediments lead to women's engagement in seasonal jobs and secondary value-chain coastal activities. Socioecological grief is rising. Women are shifting to masculine jobs. There is limited sex-disaggregated data on WE in BE sectors, such as renewable ocean energy. Positive perceptions towards women's engagement in coastal activities are emerging. If streamlined, these can create new possibilities for WE. A novel ‘blue economy for women empowerment (BEWE)’ framework is developed to sustain the emerging transformative narratives for WE in the BE and ocean sustainability. Using micro-level participatory research narratives of vulnerable coastal women/communities in the global south, and insights (policy and academic) from literature, possibilities for creating holistic WE and transformative ocean sustainability outcomes in the BE are possible. These can help promote collaborative stakeholder engagements, generate novel perspectives for positive transformations, and create evidence-based indicators for identifying progress toward ocean equity/WE. Future studies can use multi-case studies in other coastal regions to develop transformative narratives to build and sustain WE, equity, and ocean transformative actions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Alappad-india; Blue Economy; Blue Economy And Women Empowerment Framework; Global South; Ocean Equity; Ocean Sustainability; Sustainable Ocean Development Pillars; Women's Empowerment; Sustainable Development; Alappad-india; Blue Economies; Blue Economy And Woman Empowerment Framework; Global South; Ocean Development; Ocean Equity; Ocean Sustainability; Sustainable Ocean Development Pillar; Women Empowerment; Circular Economy; Economic Analysis; Empowerment; Ocean; Participatory Approach; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Womens Organization; India,Sustainable development; Alappad-india; Blue economies; Blue economy and woman empowerment framework; Global south; Ocean development; Ocean equity; Ocean sustainability; Sustainable ocean development pillar; Women empowerment; Circular economy; economic analysis; empowerment; ocean; participatory approach; sustainability; sustainable development; womens organization; India,"This project has been funded by the E4LIFE International PhD Fellowship Program offered by Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

However, existing literature has long been separating climate change from disaster risks, which were mainly considered as natural disasters. Recently, the framework of integrated understanding of climate change and disaster risk reduction in international policies started to be discussed in sustainable development discussion, while mentioning opportunities to build resilience of cultural heritage sites (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 2020). But this framework is yet to be implemented and detailed in the context of heritage sites. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze how the integrated understanding of climate change and disaster risk reduction policies can contribute to building climate resilience of cultural heritage sites by reviewing the key themes emerging from the literature. The question this paper answers are how can the integrated understanding of climate change and disaster risks reduction tackle barriers to the resilience of heritage sites? And what can be done to fill the gaps identified in the literature? To understand it, four elements from the literature are analyzed, including methodological contributions, temporalities, challenges and gaps, and opportunities. The findings of this review help in understanding the gap and interplay between science and policy in decision-making processes. We conclude by discussing the ways forward for the applicability of the framework in building resilience of cultural heritage sites. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change Adaptation; Climate Resilience; Cultural Heritage; Disaster Risk Reduction; Policy; Adaptive Management; Building; Climate Change; Cultural Heritage; Decision Making; Disaster Management; Environmental Policy; Risk Assessment,adaptive management; building; climate change; cultural heritage; decision making; disaster management; environmental policy; risk assessment,"Open Access funding provided by University of Helsinki (including Helsinki University Central Hospital).

In this study, we evaluated how human activities impact the community structure, length–weight relationships, and condition factors of key fish species in a north-central Nigeria river. Sampling was conducted over 14 months across four sites with varying levels of disturbance: Zhabyala (minimal), Tunga Waya, Chanchaga, and Korokpan (severe). A total of 1361 fish individuals, representing diverse orders and families, were collected. Dominant species such as Tilapia zillii and Tilapia guineensis featured prominently in our analysis. Site 1 exhibited the highest abundance (n = 594), while site 4 had the lowest (n = 238). Characiformes dominated the assemblage, followed by Cypriniformes and Mormyriformes. Correlation analysis highlighted strong associations between environmental factors and the length–weight relationships of dominant species. Tilapia zillii showed the highest mean standard length and body weight at site 1, whereas Tilapia guineensis demonstrated the highest standard length at site 1 and the greatest body weight at site 3. Despite favorable health indicators for many dominant species, environmental stress was evident at specific sites. This study provides crucial insights into the condition factors and ecological dynamics of dominant fish species, serving as a valuable reference for future conservation and management efforts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Condition Factor; Environmental Factors; Fish Abundance; Fish Abundance; Length–weight Relationships; Tilapia Zillii; Gold; Gold; Abiotic; Anthropogenic; Aquatic Ecosystems; Biodiversity; Invertebrates; Condition; Condition Factor; Dominant Species; Environmental Factors; Fish Abundance; Fish Species; Length–weight Relationship; North Central Nigeria; Tilapia Zillii; Fish; Abundance; Community Structure; Condition Factor; Environmental Factor; Finfish; Human Activity; Length-weight Relationship; Nature Conservation; Population Dynamics; Nigeria; Gold; Animal; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fish; Mining; River; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Gold; Mining; Rivers,Abiotic; Anthropogenic; Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Invertebrates; Condition; Condition factor; Dominant species; Environmental factors; Fish abundance; Fish species; Length–weight relationship; North Central Nigeria; Tilapia zillii; Fish; abundance; community structure; condition factor; environmental factor; finfish; human activity; length-weight relationship; nature conservation; population dynamics; Nigeria; gold; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; fish; mining; river; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Gold; Mining; Rivers,"The study was supported by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) of Nigeria by way of doctoral grant awarded to the first author at Sule Lamido University, Kafin Hausa, Nigeria with TETFUND letter referenced: TETF/DASTD/UNIV/JIGAWA STATE/VOL.1 and Sule Lamido University letter referenced: SLU/VC/TIC/002/VOL.1.","Adedokun, Omolola A., Research skills and STEM undergraduate research students' aspirations for research careers: Mediating effects of research self-efficacy, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 50, 8, pp. 940-951, (2013); Fish Aquac J, (2014); J Res Fores Wil Env, (2010); Affandi, Farhana Ahmad, Impacts of suspended sediment and metal pollution from mining activities on riverine fish population—a review, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 26, 17, pp. 16939-16951, (2019); Ahmed, Nesar, Integrated rice-fish farming in Bangladesh: Meeting the challenges of food security, Food Security, 3, 1, pp. 81-92, (2011); Journal of Agricultural Science, (2022); Turkish Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, (2005); Angermeier, Paul L., Estimating number of species and relative abundances in stream-fish communities: effects of sampling effort and discontinuous spatial distributions, Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 52, 5, pp. 936-949, (1995); Arthington, Angela Helen, Fish conservation in freshwater and marine realms: status, threats and management, Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems, 26, 5, pp. 838-857, (2016); Azevedo-Santos, Valter M., Amazon aquatic biodiversity imperiled by oil spills, Biodiversity and Conservation, 25, 13, pp. 2831-2834, (2016)",,Springer,,09441344; 16147499,,ESPLE,40053239.0,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001488933,

This paper introduces a novel framework for green investment models and platforms tailored specifically to Qatar’s unique economic landscape. Through an extensive literature review, we identify essential policy levers and principles that can enhance the effectiveness of green finance initiatives. An experimental assessment utilizing a simulation model evaluates the potential impact of various policy scenarios on key metrics such as green investment volume, job creation, and environmental impact reduction. This study advocates for a comprehensive investment policy framework that includes alignment with Qatar’s national development objectives, targeted incentives for diverse economic sectors, collaborative stakeholder engagement, and robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that implementing these design principles can dramatically accelerate green finance in Qatar, aligning initiatives with the country’s National Vision 2030 and broader sustainability goals. This paper emphasizes the critical role of fiscal incentives tailored to specific sectors, the importance of collaboration among financial institutions and governmental bodies, and the necessity of continuous performance evaluations to inform adaptive policy adjustments.

Drawing from legitimacy and stakeholder theories, the authors explore the impact of ESG controversies on insurers’ insolvency risk and the moderating effect of ESG practices on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilises a dataset comprising 120 stock insurance firms spanning from 2011 to 2022. The authors employed system-GMM estimations to control for potential endogeneity and conducted several robustness checks. Findings: ESG controversy positively influences insurers’ insolvency risk, with ESG practices mitigating these positive effects. The Governance (G) component of ESG practices plays a key role in counteracting the effects of ESG controversies on insurance companies’ insolvency risk. Originality/value: This is the first study to investigate the direct relationship between ESG controversies and insolvency risk in the insurance industry. It underscores the critical influence of stakeholders’ perceptions of the company’s legitimacy, which is determined by the number of ESG controversies undertaken by the insurer company, on its insolvency risk. Additionally, by examining the three components of ESG practices individually, the authors offer insights into how managers can gain a competitive edge, particularly by utilising governance practices as safeguards against the adverse effects of ESG controversies on their financial risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Governance; Esg Controversies; Esg Practices; Financial Risk; Insolvency Risk; Insurance Sector,,"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the research project Ref.

This research endeavours to ascertain a process facilitating the analysis and seamless integration of sustainability into corporate strategy. The goal is to establish an “integrated” ESG governance framework adept at effectively managing institutional pressures. Design/methodology/approach: This research employs an action research approach, focusing on a leading company within the sugar industry. The investigation delves into the relationship dynamics associated with business issues through a process that engages, either directly or indirectly, board members, top managers, as well as industrial and commercial customers, along with final consumers. Findings: The formulation of a sustainability strategy serves as a guiding framework for the Board of Directors in effectively navigating tensions arising from environmental, social and economic pressures. Research limitations/implications: The research contributes to bridging the realms of business governance and institutional theory (viewed under a paradoxical lens). On a managerial level, the study introduces a structured process aimed at seamlessly integrating sustainability objectives into governance, aligning with international ESG guidelines (OECD, 2023; WEF, 2020). Originality/value: The originality of this research lies in crafting a sustainability strategy by the BoD that takes into account the impact of governance and responds to the demands of strategic stakeholders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Action Research; Esg; Integrated Governance; Strategy; Sugar Industry,,,"Adamson, David C., Incorporating Uncertainty in the Economic Evaluation of Capital Investments for Water-Use Efficiency Improvements O S, Land Economics, 97, 3, pp. 655-671, (2021); Adelstein, Jennifer, Code of Ethics: A Stratified Vehicle for Compliance, Journal of Business Ethics, 138, 1, pp. 53-66, (2016); Aguilera, Ruth, The cross-national diversity of corporate governance: Dimensions and determinants, Academy of Management Review, 28, 3, pp. 447-465, (2003); Aguilera, Ruth, The Corporate Governance of Environmental Sustainability: A Review and Proposal for More Integrated Research, Journal of Management, 47, 6, pp. 1468-1497, (2021); Aguilera, Ruth, Putting the s back in corporate social responsibility: A multilevel theory of social change in organizations, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 836-863, (2007); Ahmed, Shaila, Toward a political economy of corporate governance change and stability in family business groups: A morphogenetic approach, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 31, 8, pp. 2192-2217, (2018); Alsayegh, Maha Faisal, Corporate economic, environmental, and social sustainability performance transformation through ESG disclosure, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2020); Andersson, Emil, ESG investment: What do we learn from its interaction with stock, currency and commodity markets?, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 27, 3, pp. 3623-3639, (2022); Arnold, Chris, Ethical Marketing and the New Consumer, pp. 1-272, (2015); Azapagic, Adisa, Systems Approach to Corporate Sustainability: A General Management Framework, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 81, 5, pp. 303-316, (2003)",,Emerald Publishing,,00251747,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194546189,

As climate change increasingly threatens global economies, ecosystems, and public health, financial experts recognize the potential for the banking sector to contribute to a low-carbon economy. By incorporating green-banking practices, which blend traditional financial services with environmental, social, and economic considerations, banks can foster sustainable development while reaping financial benefits. The research examines the dynamics of sustainable banking, focusing on its ability to drive efficiency improvements through eco-friendly programs and enhance profitability. Furthermore, the study discusses the challenges in adopting and implementing environmental sustainability, comparing the command-and-control regulatory model with voluntary approaches. The findings emphasize the importance of effective regulation and incentives for ensuring that banks adopt sustainable practices, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and low-carbon economic system. Through this analysis, this study underscores the banking industry′s pivotal role in shaping the transition towards a sustainable future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking Sectors; Climate Change; Environment; Financial Intuitions; Sustainability; Banking; Climate Change; Environmental Technology; Financial Services; Policy Implementation; Profitability; Research Work; Sustainable Development,banking; climate change; environmental technology; financial services; policy implementation; profitability; research work; sustainable development,,"Stranded Assets, (2025); Haines, Andy P., Global health watch: monitoring impacts of environmental change, The Lancet, 342, 8885, pp. 1464-1469, (1993); Goodell, John W., COVID-19 and finance: Agendas for future research, Finance Research Letters, 35, (2020); Blake, James, Overcoming the 'value-action gap' in environmental policy: Tensions between national policy and local experience, Local Environment, 4, 3, pp. 257-278, (1999); Ph D Thesis, (2018); Ifc Report no 14 on Sustainable Finance Data for Central Banks, (2021); ZHU, Qinghua, Green supply chain management: pressures, practices and performance within the Chinese automobile industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 15, 11-12, pp. 1041-1052, (2007); Coulson, Andrea B., How should banks govern the environment?

Unstandardized and dispersed housing data impedes a comprehensive assessment of housing stock characteristics and life cycle impacts, hindering the implementation of circular economy principles. The HPKG addresses this challenge by providing (1) a standardized framework for integrated analysis of residential buildings’ affordability and circularity across various spatiotemporal scales and socioeconomic contexts, and (2) a scalable semantic infrastructure using web ontologies that enhances the sharability, searchability, readability, and interoperability of housing-related data. A case study involving five Canadian cities demonstrates the HPKG's effectiveness in semantically linking and standardizing approximately 62 million data points representing over 1.2 million residential buildings. The results show how the HPKG enables a multi-scale integrated assessment of Canadian housing stock, focusing on affordability, energy efficiency, and environmental footprints. As a key conclusion, the HPKG supports informed decisions regarding housing stock by enabling the exploration of circular economy scenarios that prioritize the reuse and recycling of residential building materials. The HPKG empowers stakeholders to develop residential typologies that promote affordability, circularity, and sustainability across diverse socioeconomic contexts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Built Environment; Circular Economy; Data Intelligence; Housing; Semantic Technology; Built Environment; Circular Economy; Data Intelligence; Digital Standardizations; Housing Stock; Knowledge Graphs; Residential Building; Semantic Technologies; Socio-economics; Urban Residential Buildings; Construction Material; Ecological Footprint; Energy Efficiency; Green Economy; Housing Market; Life Cycle Analysis; Recycling; Residential Development; Socioeconomic Conditions; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Stakeholder; Standardization; Urban Housing,Built environment; Circular economy; Data intelligence; Digital standardizations; Housing stock; Knowledge graphs; Residential building; Semantic technologies; Socio-economics; Urban residential buildings; construction material; ecological footprint; energy efficiency; green economy; housing market; life cycle analysis; recycling; residential development; socioeconomic conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; standardization; urban housing,"Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the excellent work of the Data Homebase team at McGill's TRACE lab and collaborators from the McGill Schools of Architecture, Geography and Computer Science, and McGill Library.

According to the Global Risk Report 2023, biodiversity loss will be the fourth most significant risk worldwide over the next ten years. The financial sector plays a crucial role in supporting and financing business activities that impact biodiversity. Financial institutions can help ensure that biodiversity is protected as they strongly influence management activities and practices in the economy through capital allocation. Based on institutional theory, this study aims to illuminate a disclosure level on biodiversity (risks) in the financial sector. Using content analysis, we empirically investigate non-financial reports by the European financial industry. To evaluate drivers, we present and compare specific disclosure standards and regulations concerning biodiversity. Overall, the disclosure quality differs in scope and level across the sampled companies. The results show the relevance of evolving disclosure frameworks like the EU taxonomy, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. This study contributes to improving biodiversity management and disclosure by presenting a better understanding of biodiversity activities and risks within the financial sector as a mediating agent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biodiversity; Biodiversity Disclosure; Biodiversity Reporting; Finance; Financial Sector; Non-financial Reporting; Biodiversity; Business; European Union; Financial Crisis; Spatiotemporal Analysis,biodiversity; business; European Union; financial crisis; spatiotemporal analysis,,"Addison, Prue Frances Elizabeth, Using conservation science to advance corporate biodiversity accountability, Conservation Biology, 33, 2, pp. 307-318, (2019); Adler, Ralph W., United Nations Decade on Biodiversity: A study of the reporting practices of the Australian mining industry, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 30, 8, pp. 1711-1745, (2017); Adler, Ralph W., Biodiversity and threatened species reporting by the top Fortune Global companies, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 31, 3, pp. 787-825, (2018); Around the World in 80 Species Exploring the Business of Extinction, (2019); Atkins, Jill Frances, EXTINCTION GOVERNANCE, FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING: Implementing a Species Protection Action Plan for the Financial Markets, pp. 1-582, (2022); Atkins, Jill Frances, EXTINCTION ACCOUNTING, FINANCE AND ENGAGEMENT: Implementing a Species Protection Action Plan for the Financial Markets, pp. 13-55, (2022); Atkins, Jill Frances, Integrated extinction accounting and accountability: building an ark, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 31, 3, pp. 750-786, (2018); Atkins, Jill Frances, From the Big Five to the Big Four?

With a focus on acute events, we measure biodiversity loss as a risk. After introducing a novel news-based metric to track biodiversity risk and identify key acute episodes we propose an event study to measure the market effect of acute biodiversity events on the spreads of Brazilian corporate bonds. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to investigate the linkages between acute biodiversity events and micro-level security pricing. We show that most of the studied events appear to be priced into the corporate bond market segment linked to biodiversity impact, establishing financial dependency within the double materiality principle.

However, before recycling of plastics can be considered a safe practice, the flaws in today's systems must be addressed. Plastics contain a vast range of chemicals, including monomers, polymers, processing agents, fillers, antioxidants, plasticizers, pigments, microbiocides and stabilizers. The amounts and types of chemicals in plastics products vary, and there are little requirements for transparency and reporting. Additionally, they are inherently contaminated with reaction by-products and other nonintentionally added substances (NIASs). As the chemical composition of plastics wastes is largely unknown, and many plastics chemicals are hazardous, they therefore hinder safe recycling since recyclers are not able to exclude materials that contain hazardous chemicals. To address this problem, we suggest the following policy strategies: 1) improved reporting, transparency and traceability of chemicals in plastics throughout their full life cycle; 2) chemical simplification and group-based approaches to regulating hazardous chemicals; 3) chemical monitoring, testing and quality control; 4) economic incentives that follow the waste hierarchy; and 5) support for a just transition to protect people, including waste pickers, impacted throughout the plastics life cycle. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Circular Economy; Nonintentionally Added Substances; Plastics Additives; Plastics Circularity; Plastics Pollution,,,"Fraud of Plastic Recycling how Big Oil and the Plastics Industry Deceived the Public for Decades and Caused the Plastic Waste Crisis, (2024); Al-Salem, S.

These practices reduced annual paper consumption by 1,200 metric tons (avoiding deforestation of ~20,000 trees) and cut operational costs by 15% through digitization (SBI Sustainability Report, 2023, p. 12). Carbon emissions fell by 28% (2020–2023), driven by solar-powered ATMs (1,200 units installed) and paperless transactions (45 million annually). Leveraging mixed methods, this study analyzes GB’s benefits and customer awareness using primary data from 50 SBI customers (interviews) and secondary data (reports, publications). Statistical analyses like Garrett’s ranking, t-tests, ANOVA, and SEM reveal that digital literacy moderates demographic influences on GB adoption. Higher education correlates with awareness, while age-education interactions highlight adoption barriers. Gender showed no significant impact. Findings underscore SBI’s alignment with India’s net-zero goals but emphasize the need for targeted education and cybersecurity measures. The study bridges stakeholder theory with empirical insights, demonstrating how banks can harmonize profitability and environmental responsibility. Results advocate scalable policies, such as incentivizing green loans and enhancing digital literacy, to mainstream GB practices in emerging economies, offering a blueprint for sustainable banking transformation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Customer Awareness; Environmental Responsibility; Green Banking; State Bank Of India; Sustainable Development,,,"Journal of Financial Innovation, (2022); Sustainable Finance Review, (2015); International Journal of Sustainable Economics, (2022); Environmental Economics, (2022); Journal of Cleaner Production, (2019); Sustainability, (2024); Journal of Consumer Behaviour, (2023); Energy Economics, (2023); Glavee-Geo, Richard, Mobile banking services adoption in Pakistan: are there gender differences?, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 35, 7, pp. 1088-1112, (2017); Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling Pls Sem Using R A Workbook, (2021)",,Science Publishing Corporation Inc.,,23094508,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008155782,

Islamic finance, which has its roots in Shariah principles, encourages ethical and responsible investing as well as the fair distribution of income and wealth, all of which contribute to sustainability agenda. This chapter looks at how Islamic principles can be incorporated into the practice of responsible and significant finance by analyzing the principles of sustainability from the Islamic finance perspective. One key area where Islamic finance can contribute to sustainability is in promoting responsible consumption and production, which are central to achieving SDG 12. By prioritizing investments in ethical industries and environmentally conscious practices, Islamic finance can support a transition to more sustainable production models. This exploration seeks to shed light on the potential of Islamic finance to play a role in promoting SDGs, offering insights and guidance for regulators, policymakers, and Islamic financial institutions. By aligning Islamic finance with the global sustainability agenda, we can create a more ethical, inclusive, and responsible financial ecosystem that benefits future generations.

With this in mind, the banking sector is not an exception when it comes to the applicability of green leadership. In the banking sector, some notable strides were witnessed in the past decade whereby financial institutions partially adopted the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Environmental challenges appear to be a missing link in the Zimbabwean banking sector as compared to social and governance issues of the ESG framework. Cognizant of the fact that many African economies are encountering daunting environmental challenges, green leadership in the banking sector is an urgent need of the hour. Without a deeper understanding of green leadership, it is of utmost importance to note that the attainment of ESG goals and targets can be very cumbersome, especially in African countries. Surprisingly, according to the authors’ best knowledge, there is no study conducted on the interaction between green leadership and ESG practices in the banking sector in Zimbabwe. Accordingly, this chapter captures the interaction between green leadership and ESG practices in Zimbabwe. With the effective adoption of green leadership, the Zimbabwean bankers can successfully implement the ESG framework toward fostering a green economy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Assessing Esg Reporting Practices in Swedish Banks Approaches and Barriers, (2023); Modern Science and Research, (2024); Am J Ind Bus Manag, (2023); Câmara, Paulo, The Systemic Interaction Between Corporate Governance and ESG, pp. 3-40, (2022); Esg and Sdg Reporting in Zimbabwe Ready or Not Here They Come, (2023); Journal of Sustainability in Africa, (2023); Climate Bonds Initiative, (2023); Emerging Challenges Solutions and Best Practices for Digital Enterprise Transformation, (2021); Dzingirai, Mufaro, Managerial challenges under FinTech: Evidence from Zimbabwean commercial banks, pp. 141-166, (2020); International Journal of Corporate Finance and Accounting, (2022)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781032849379; 9781040300589,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214776691,

We use them to study how climate-related natural disasters affect the predictive distribution of output growth and inflation. Disasters strongly shift the forecast distribution particularly in the tails. They result in an initial sharp increase of the downside risk for growth, followed by a temporary rebound. Upside risk to inflation increases markedly for a few months and then subsides. As a result, natural disasters have a persistent impact on the conditional variance and skewness of macroeconomic aggregates which standard linear models estimating conditional mean dynamics fail to match. We perform a scenario analysis to evaluate the hypothetical effects of more frequent large disasters on the macroeconomy due to increased atmospheric carbon concentration. Our results indicate a substantially higher conditional volatility of growth and inflation as well as increased upside risk to inflation particularly in a scenario where only currently pledged climate policies are implemented. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Counterfactual Distribution Forecasts; Disaster Scenario Analysis; Quantile Vector Autoregression; Counterfactual Distribution Forecast; Counterfactuals; Disaster Scenario; Disaster Scenario Analyze; Impulse Response Functions; Natural Disasters; Quantile Vector Autoregression; Scenarios Analysis; Vector Autoregressions; Vector Autoregressive Model; Inflation,Counterfactual distribution forecast; Counterfactuals; Disaster scenario; Disaster scenario analyze; Impulse response functions; Natural disasters; Quantile vector autoregression; Scenarios analysis; Vector autoregressions; Vector autoregressive model; Inflation,,"Acemoglu, Daron, The network origins of aggregate fluctuations, Econometrica, 80, 5, pp. 1977-2016, (2012); Albala-Bertrand, José M., Natural disaster situations and growth: A macroeconomic model for sudden disaster impacts, World Development, 21, 9, pp. 1417-1434, (1993); Climate Shocks Cyclones and Economic Growth Bridging the Micro Macro Gap, (2018); Feds Notes, (2017); Berkowitz, Jeremy, Evaluating value-at-risk models with desk-level data, Management Science, 57, 12, pp. 2213-2227, (2011); Botzen, W.

Research grows on a positive correlation between ESG and corporate performance, and 2023 constitutes a turning point marked by a backlash in the U.S. This has prompted a reassessment of sustainability strategies and raised concerns about potential conflicts with the fiduciary duties of directors and portfolio managers. This paper explores the tension between ESG and shareholder primacy under Delaware law, which is home to 66% of Fortune 500 companies. It is a contribution to the theories of shareholder primacy and corporate governance with the most up-to-date evidence, at the intersection of law, economics and finance. Although Delaware courts have not specifically approached the liability extent of directors and asset managers in ESG-related decisions, they have established the elements of the fiduciary duties of care and loyalty, which can be applied to ESG-aligned decisions. This paper highlights guidelines for directors, portfolio managers and fiduciaries when making ESG-aligned decisions, in particular the careful documentation of the process followed in reaching a decision. The paper also calls for more rigour in the field of sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Delaware Law; Duty Of Care; Duty Of Loyalty; Esg; Fiduciary Duty; Corporate Strategy; Decision Making; Environmental Economics; Governance Approach; Guideline; Industrial Performance; Performance Assessment; Regulatory Framework; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; Europe; United States,corporate strategy; decision making; environmental economics; governance approach; guideline; industrial performance; performance assessment; regulatory framework; strategic approach; sustainability; Europe; United States,,"473 A 2d 805 812 Delaware Court of Chancery 1984, (1984); Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, (2019); Harvard Business Review, (2022); Esg Assets May Hit 53 Trillion by 2025 A Third of Global Aum, (2021); Bosmans, Pieter, The Blue Bond Market: A Catalyst for Ocean and Water Financing, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 16, 3, (2023); 746 A 2d 244 Delaware Court of Chancery, (2000); Blackrock State Street Among Money Managers Closing Esg Funds, (2023); Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, (2023); Starting Early on Esg and Sustainability Strategies can Support Growth Long Term for Privately Held Companies, (2023); Journal of Impact and Esg Investing, (2020)",,Routledge,,14664283; 00036846,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200362569,

By investigating the motivations and practices of Indonesian companies, they provide insights into how sustainability is interpreted and implemented. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative research approach, informed by stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory, was used. Semi-structured interviews with 27 managers from eight Indonesian listed companies and three managers from two large Indonesian institutional investors were carried out. Content analysis of company sustainability and annual reports was also conducted to triangulate the interview data. Findings – This study shows that mandatory reporting in Indonesia does not automatically impact how companies address material issues due to a lack of regulatory detail. The study reveals that there is a hierarchy of relevant stakeholders with both institutional investors and lenders prioritizing financial materiality over impact materiality with institutional stakeholders driving sustainability in environmentally-sensitive industries. The findings also show that companies report on sustainability mainly for legitimacy purposes, which is driven by regulatory and institutional pressures. Environmentally-sensitive industries prioritize impact materiality due to heightened legitimacy risks. The institutional investors focus on “Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO)” as a key governance mechanism while treating environment social and governance risk ratings mainly as supplementary information. Practical implications – This study offers practical implications for institutional investors and regulators in developing economies. It highlights the need for clearer materiality guidance and stronger governance mechanisms, such as UBO transparency, to enhance sustainability performance in high-corruption environments like Indonesia. Originality/value – This study reveals the influence that mandatory sustainability reporting has in Indonesia, showing that regulatory compliance does not necessarily lead to sustainability impact. The authors also show how institutional factors in developing economies shape double materiality implementation. The research exposes critical gaps in reporting practices, emphasizing the need for a context-specific approach to sustainability performance and reporting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Indonesia; Legitimacy Theory; Materiality; Stakeholder Theory; Sustainability Performance; Sustainability Reporting,,,"Abeysekera, Indra, A framework for sustainability reporting, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 13, 6, pp. 1386-1409, (2022); Adams, Carol A., Progress: engaging with organisations in pursuit of improved sustainability accounting and performance, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 32, 8, pp. 2367-2394, (2019); Ahmad, Zubair, Corporate governance regulation in regulatory space of a developing country: actors, strategies and outcomes, Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies, 14, 1, pp. 99-124, (2024); Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); An, Esther, Accelerating sustainability through better reporting, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 14, 4, pp. 904-914, (2023); Archel Domench, Pablo, Social disclosure, legitimacy theory and the role of the state, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 22, 8, pp. 1284-1307, (2009); Artiach, Tracy C., The determinants of corporate sustainability performance, Accounting and Finance, 50, 1, pp. 31-51, (2010); Atz, Ulrich, Does sustainability generate better financial performance? review, meta-analysis, and propositions, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 13, 1, pp. 802-825, (2023); Barker, Richard W., Seeing double corporate reporting through the materiality lenses of both investors and nature*, Accounting Forum, 49, 2, pp. 259-289, (2025); Bellucci, Marco, Stakeholder engagement and dialogic accounting: Empirical evidence in sustainability reporting, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 32, 5, pp. 1467-1499, (2019)",,Emerald Publishing,,20415494; 01140582,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105016476355,

The case introduces a flood-adjusted property valuation (FAPV) model, which uses a probabilistic approach to estimate property values discounted for flood risk in flood-prone areas. The FAPV model is then applied to calculate the Loan-to-Value ratio, followed by a discussion on strategies for mitigating flood risk within the portfolio. The teaching case includes a complete teaching schedule and methodology, requiring only a foundational understanding of probability and basic Excel skills.

Cooperation in the fight against global warming seems to be one of the few areas where a strategic partnership might still be possible. Within the field of climate change governance, the issue of climate finance has gained substantial significance and was at the core of COP29. Here, important developments indicate a complex scenario for future collaboration: the EU’s hopes to preserve climate change as an “island of opportunity” for collaboration meet a Chinese revision of climate policy that seeks to raise it to a key foreign policy issue—thus linking it with core interests. At the technical level, despite several MoUs and declarations of intended cooperation, in climate finance, China and the EU have not agreed on a Chinese contribution to the Loss and Damage Fund at COP28. Finally, regarding the New Collective Quantified Goal on Finance, the EU and China are aligned on the importance of an updated goal but differ on how climate finance obligations should be structured. In the paper, we explore the current state of affairs in EU-China cooperation regarding climate finance (governance). We highlight the recent revision of China’s foreign policy approach and trace the positioning of both sides toward and at COP29.

Design/methodology: Utilizing a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative and qualitative analyses, this research provides an empirical examination of ESG criteria application within the Spanish insurance sector. The study adopts the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) framework to assess ESG implementation across leading insurance companies by employing cluster analysis and Qualitative Comparative Analysis. The empirical study is based on a purposive sample of frontrunner insurance companies in the Spanish market, specifically those that are signatories of the UN-endorsed Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI). Findings: The findings reveal that multinational companies generally outperform in ESG criteria due to their formal governance structures. Key insights include strong performance in strategy and investment management but weaker engagement in claims management and product innovation. Practical implications: The article offers valuable insights for managers by providing a comprehensive and detailed understanding of how leading companies in the insurance industry are implementing ESG criteria. Moreover, it highlights patterns and differences among companies based on their segment and main characteristics. The findings can also be beneficial to regulators and organizations promoting ESG implementation, as well as those responsible for developing the reference frameworks used in the analysis. The study helps identify the variables where ESG criteria are more thoroughly embedded and highlights areas that require further strengthening in terms of ESG approaches. Social Implications: This article offers insights into how insurance companies incorporate the social aspect of the ESG framework. It also emphasizes the significance of understanding and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and other key elements related to sustainability. Originality/value: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand—both from regulators and stakeholders—for ESG integration in the financial sector. Within the academic context, the study contributes to the limited empirical research on ESG adoption in the insurance industry by offering a robust framework, model, and methodology for ESG assessment, as well as identifying patterns in ESG adoption. Additionally, the article explores how the combination of outstanding PSI principles achievements influences the ESG rating performance of insurance companies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate; Environmental; Esg; Finance; Governance; Green; Insurance; Social; Sustainability,,,"Abraham, K.

While financial development is increasingly recognized as a potential enabler of sustainability, its empirical linkage to CE outcomes remains underexplored. This study investigates the relationship between financial development—measured by domestic credit to the private sector (% of GDP)—and municipal waste generation per capita across 28 European countries from 2000 to 2020. Using a robust empirical strategy that includes fixed effects, instrumental variables (IV) estimation, and panel quantile regression, we assess whether access to credit supports or undermines CE performance. Municipal waste per capita serves as an inverse proxy for CE, capturing material inefficiencies and the persistence of linear economic models. Results consistently show a positive and significant association between financial development and waste generation, suggesting that, in the absence of environmental targeting, expanded credit may reinforce consumption-driven waste. The findings underscore the importance of aligning financial sector growth with sustainability objectives through green finance instruments and regulatory incentives.

Adopting a content analysis of nonfinancial reports published in 2024 by the European banks included in the sample, the research highlights advances in climate-related disclosure, particularly regarding climate risk management, transition strategies, and stakeholder engagement initiatives. The findings reveal substantial alignment with global frameworks such as GRI, ESRS, and TCFD, but also identify persistent gaps in areas like unidentified risks, climate-induced migration, land degradation and desertification, tourism, and infrastructure. While stakeholder-oriented governance is gaining traction, the findings indicate that the traditional tension between shareholder value and broader stakeholder interests is being attenuated as banks increasingly align their climate strategies and disclosures with both financial imperatives and societal expectations.

By categorizing trust into expertise trust and benevolence trust, the research reveals how different dimensions of ESG activities influence these trust types and their subsequent effect on purchase behavior. Employing survey data from 628 participants and structural equation modeling, the findings indicate that while environmental, social, and governance activities positively affect benevolence trust, they do not significantly influence expertise trust. Notably, social activities exhibit the strongest impact on benevolence trust, underscoring their importance in shaping consumer perceptions. Expertise trust, however, plays a more critical role in driving purchase intention, suggesting that SMEs should strategically focus on enhancing technical capabilities and effectively communicating their competencies to consumers. The study highlights the need for SMEs to integrate ESG practices with targeted promotional strategies, such as leveraging social media, to bridge the gap in consumer awareness.

Our aim is to provide a synthesis and extension of the current literature as follows: (i) review theoretical (i.e., socio-political, economic-based and market-based) perspectives employed by existing studies, (ii) critique methodological aspects and contextual design of past studies and (iii) discuss empirical findings on the determinants and consequences of TCFD reporting. Consulting three authoritative databases of ‘Scopus’, ‘Web of Science’ and ‘Business Source Complete’, we employ a three-stage systematic literature review (SLR) method with a PRISMA and content analysis strategy to review 230 papers published in 101 high-quality journals from 2016 to January 2025. Our findings are fourfold. First, the majority of the studies reviewed are descriptive in nature, with limited theoretical insights. Second, we find that existing studies are predominantly narrative reports in nature that focus on the extent of TCFD implementation. By contrast, empirical evidence on the determinants and consequences of TCFD reporting is rare. Third, the existing studies have focused on few developed countries, whilst cross-country comparative studies remain limited. Finally, we outline a number of promising opportunities for future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Reporting Tcfd Reporting Framework; Social And Environmental Accounting; Sustainability Reporting; Systematic Literature Review,,This work was supported by the Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan and Center for Higher Education Funding (BPPT).

Drawing on panel data on green lending from 2015 to 2023, the empirical analysis reveals that such misalignment is primarily influenced by the country and sector in which the financed firms operate. The main findings indicate a positive relationship between green lending and the environmental performance of the country where the firm is based. Moreover, the significant presence of carbon-intensive sectors within national economies shapes banks' credit allocation decisions, reflecting broader structural characteristics rather than bank-specific strategies. Policymakers are therefore encouraged to support the alignment of bank lending with climate goals through public policies and enhanced regulations that promote firms' business model innovation. In addition, the implementation of appropriate macroprudential tools may help address the systemic dimension of climate-related financial risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking Industry; Credit Portfolio; Environmental Policy; Sustainable Finance,,"This study was funded by the European Union \u2010 NextGenerationEU, Mission 4, Component 2, in the framework of the GRINS \u2010 Growing Resilient, INclusive and Sustainable project (GRINS PE00000018 \u2010 CUP E63C22002120006).

Specifically, it analyses investment disputes relating to renewable energy and concludes that investment law has a role to play in increasing the energy mix. While attainment of the SDGs requires the adoption of aggressive laws and policies, policymakers should also not discard the benefits of international investment agreements (IIAs). The analysis further identifies that the transition to a green economy is not happening fast enough, and is not directed enough towards the developing world. Moreover, while IIL has the potential to play a role in renewable energy related investment, policy coherence is also required for development, as a variety of laws beyond IIAs are required to meet SDG 7. In this regard, IIA reform alongside other investment related polices can be targeted to address policy objectives at the core of SDG 7. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Feed-in Tariffs; Investment; Investment Arbitration; Regulatory Flexibility; Renewable Energy; Clean Energy; Economics; Energy Policy; Green Development; Green Economy; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development Goals; Critical Analysis; Energy; Energy Mix; Feed-in Tariff; International Investments; Investment Arbitration; Policy Makers; Regulatory Flexibility; Renewable Energies; Investments,Clean energy; Economics; Energy policy; Green development; Green economy; Renewable energy; Sustainable development goals; Critical analysis; Energy; Energy mix; Feed-in tariff; International investments; Investment arbitration; Policy makers; Regulatory flexibility; Renewable energies; Investments,,"Renewable Power Sharply Falling Generation Costs, (2017); OECD Iea 2017; Data Worldbank Org; Data Worldbank Org; Schwerhoff, Gregor, Financing renewable energy in Africa – Key challenge of the sustainable development goals, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 75, pp. 393-401, (2017); Ouédraogo, Nadia S., Opportunities, Barriers and Issues with Renewable Energy Development in Africa: a Comprehensible Review, Current Sustainable/Renewable Energy Reports, 6, 2, pp. 52-60, (2019); Cantore, Nicola, Promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency in Africa: A framework to evaluate employment generation and cost effectiveness, Environmental Research Letters, 12, 3, (2017); OECD Environment Working Papers, (2012); 2012 World Investment and Political Risk World Investment Trends and Corporate Perspectives Sovereign Default and Expropriation the Political Risk Insurance Industry, (2013); Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change 2007 the Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2014)",,Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.,,,9781789908930; 9781789908923,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011019143,

This Article argues that the Commission should recommend reforming the law from the frameworks regulating institutional shareholders for their engagement practices if it aspires this law to steer them towards governing and undertaking “double-materiality-minded engagement practices”. For institutional shareholders to do the former, the effect of several factors on their treatment of engagement practices and the challenges involved with governing and undertaking double-materiality-minded engagement practices must be mitigated and overcome. The efficacy of this law in helping to address these as it interacts with key EU sectoral laws lies in facilitating market-led regulation about them. However, such market-led regulation will not enable the governance and undertaking of double-materiality-minded engagement practices without changing the structures guiding institutional shareholders’ treatment of engagement practices and the legal imperative for it. Care, though, should be exercised in reforming the law, for the reform must be mindful of the issues mentioned. In light of this, the Article proposes introducing forward-looking rules centred on stewardship teams and regulatory tools allowing experimentation with double-materiality-minded engagement practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Shareholder Engagement; Sustainable Business; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Finance,,"The author would like to thank David Milman, John Wood, Sofia Ellina, David Campbell, Thomas Peck and the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and feedback in earlier drafts of this paper.

Secondary data were collected from 2013 to 2023. The research results were based on 712 responses from insurance company employees, insurance consumers, and domestic insurance experts. Using quantitative research methods, PLS-SEM linear structural modeling was performed using SPSS and AMOS 20 software. The results indicate that CSR is positively correlated with the profitability of insurance businesses, primarily through the responsibility of insurance companies to consumers. Recommended solutions include: 1) Commitment to the quality of CSR reporting; 2) Protecting consumer rights through model transaction contracts; 3) Implementing a code of business ethics; 4) Addressing issues in the insurance compensation settlement process.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the implementation of disaster and climate risk-sensitive business continuity plans of selected SMEs in the post-COVID19 context in Sri Lanka. This study was carried out in the post-COVID19 period and in a context of multiple socio-economic shocks in addition to the existing climate and disaster risks. This case study identified flood/heavy rain, heavy wind, drought/water scarcity, and heat waves as climate change drivers for disaster risks to SMEs in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. A number of key risk management strategies for potential disaster/climate risks in the SME sector were explored from this study. This study found that the level of awareness of such disaster risk-sensitive strategies, primarily the risk mitigation measures need to be systematically inculcated in the studied sectors of SMEs (handloom and food/vegetable processing) in Sri Lanka. The COVID19 pandemic and the post-economic crisis have created an opportunity to promote risk-sensitive SMEs operational plans. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business Continuity Plan; Climate Risk; Disaster Risk; Risk-sensitive; Sme; Sri Lanka; Climate Change; Disasters; Economic Analysis; Risk Management; Risk Perception; Business Continuity Plans; Climate Change Adaptation; Climate Risk; Disaster Risk; Operation Strategy; Policy Intervention; Risk-sensitive; Small-and-medium Enterprise; Socio-economics; Sri Lanka; Risk Assessment,Climate change; Disasters; Economic analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Business continuity plans; Climate change adaptation; Climate risk; Disaster risk; Operation strategy; Policy intervention; Risk-sensitive; Small-and-medium enterprise; Socio-economics; Sri Lanka; Risk assessment,,"Alam, Ashraful, SMEs respond to climate change: Evidence from developing countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 185, (2022); Al-Dosari, Khalifa Youssef Mubarak, Risk-Management Framework and Information-Security Systems for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): A Meta-Analysis Approach, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 17, (2023); Business Unusual Why the Climate is Changing the Rules for Our Cities and Smes, (2015); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2014); Building Philippine Smes Resilience to Natural Disasters, (2015); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2020); Botzen, W.

The study was conducted at a refueling station in Dumat Al-Jandal, Saudi Arabia, with the aim of meeting the daily hydrogen demand of 25 kg and addressing the region’s high wind energy potential. HOMER software was used to model and optimize various system configurations, ensuring the integration of solar photovoltaic arrays, wind turbines, converters, batteries, electrolyzers, and hydrogen storage tanks. The optimized system achieved a levelized cost of energy of $0.452 per kWh, hydrogen production costs of $6.22 per kg, and a net present cost of $645,000. Furthermore, it contributes to the reduction of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by 372 metric tons annually, thereby demonstrating environmental and economic benefits. This study advances previous research by incorporating a hybrid energy model tailored for refueling stations and optimizing the economic parameters to enhance cost-effectiveness and system sustainability. The findings provide critical insights for policymakers, investors, and energy planners, supporting the integration of hybrid renewable energy systems into the hydrogen refueling infrastructure.

This bottom-up pressure remains overlooked in the rapidly expanding literature on the politics of sustainable finance. With a focus on environmental (mis)conduct, the paper investigates the corporate shaming of banks by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and grassroots groups. The empirical investigation of this outside lobbying is articulated in three questions: (1) What are the environmental issues for which CSOs shame banks? (2) Which CSOs shame banks? and (3) Which banks are shamed by CSOs? Corporate and political opportunity structures are considered in a multivariate analysis to examine how the risk of CSO criticism varies across banks and countries. The empirical exploration covers CSO advocacy against the Top-1000 banks worldwide for the period 2010–2022. The paper relies on data from Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) controversies.

Using a dataset of Chinese companies listed in the A-share market between 2015 and 2022 and employing three-stage least squares statistics to address the endogeneity issue, we found that ESGP is negatively associated with SPCR. Notably, BGD exhibits a positive association with SPCR. However, the interaction between ESGP and BGD reveals a negative relationship with SPCR, suggesting that ESGP moderates the positive effect of BGD on crash-related risk. Our results still hold even after conducting a series of robustness checks, such as using a fixed effect model, a two-step GMM estimator, and alternative measures of ESGP and BGD. This study contributes to the governance and sustainability literature by highlighting the influence of ESGP and BGD on SPCR and their interactive role in mitigating crash risk through enhanced transparency, stronger stakeholder relations, and improved risk management. It offers valuable organisational and policy implications, suggesting that Chinese listed companies can leverage ESGP to effectively reduce SPCR and strengthen corporate governance practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Board Gender Diversity; China; Csr; Esg Performance; Stock Price Crash Risk,,,"Adams, Renée B., Shareholders and stakeholders: How do directors decide?, Strategic Management Journal, 32, 12, pp. 1331-1355, (2011); Alatawi, Ibrahim A., CSR, financial and non-financial performance in the tourism sector: A systematic literature review and future research agenda, International Review of Financial Analysis, 89, (2023); Albuquerque, Rui, Corporate social responsibility and firm risk: Theory and empirical evidence, Management Science, 65, 10, pp. 4451-4469, (2019); Al-Qahtani, Maryam, The effect of board diversity on disclosure and management of greenhouse gas information: evidence from the United Kingdom, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 33, 6, pp. 1557-1579, (2020); Andreou, Panayiotis C., Corporate Governance and Firm-specific Stock Price Crashes, European Financial Management, 22, 5, pp. 916-956, (2016); Aouadi, Amal, Do ESG Controversies Matter for Firm Value?

Physical climate effects are material dependencies for agricultural businesses and may severely affect their performance and compromise their survival. This study’s aim is to analyze the comprehensive effect of climate change factors on agricultural firm bankruptcies in a European geographical area that is especially susceptible to climate change. Employing a panel of 15 036 agricultural firms, we analyze the effects of adverse climatic conditions in the firm’s headquarters area using logit regressions, an instrumental variable ordinary least squares model, and the gradient-boosting ensemble method. We find that bankruptcy is conditioned upon extreme weather events, indicating that climate change’s physical impacts on firm resources already materially affect the agricultural sector’s resilience and survival. Specifically, abnormally high temperatures, precipitation, and the incidence of fires are significant factors that contribute to bankruptcy or insolvency. Furthermore, a “fire weather” index comprising high temperatures, drought, and wind, combined with fire occurrence, intensifies the bankruptcy risk of agricultural businesses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Sector; Bankruptcy; Physical Climate Risk; Wildfire,,This study was upported by Grant PID2021-124950OB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by ERDF A way of making Europe.,"Annarelli, Alessandro, Strategic and operational management of organizational resilience: Current state of research and future directions, Omega (United Kingdom), 62, pp. 1-18, (2016); Ascui, Francisco, Implementing natural capital credit risk assessment in agricultural lending, Business Strategy and the Environment, 28, 6, pp. 1234-1249, (2019); Atif, Muhammad, Environmental, social and governance disclosure and default risk, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 8, pp. 3937-3959, (2021); Resource Based Theory Creating and Sustaining Competitive Advantage, (2007); Climate Risks in the U S Banking Sector Evidence from Operational Losses and Extreme Storms, (2023); Berkhout, Frans G.H., Adaptation to climate change by organizations, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 3, 1, pp. 91-106, (2012); Berrone, Pascual, Necessity as the mother of 'green' inventions: Institutional pressures and environmental innovations, Strategic Management Journal, 34, 8, pp. 891-909, (2013); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Ecological Economic Papers, (2019); Impacts of Extreme Weather Events on Mortgage Risks and their Evolution Under Climate Change A Case Study on Florida, (2025)",,Wageningen Academic Publishers,,15592448,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007309554,

Approximately 40% of the world’s population lives in coastal regions with 3 billion people depending on it for livelihood. 80% of the global trade is (en)routed via oceans. A long-term unbalanced usage of marine routes leads to unsettling issues such as ocean-acidification, marine pollution and habitat destruction. This causes disruption towards the attainment of sustainability. To safeguard the oceans and marine life, “Blue Economy (BE)"" was introduced by the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012. The SDG-14 (life below water) contributes to focusing attention on BE. Till date there is no universally accepted policy towards implementation of BE.

The overall result of the worldwide economic liberalization of the 1980s is loosely regulated market-led and financialized economies that usually function in systemic crisis mode. Economic, political, and social decisions are related to the financial markets efficiency criterion. Such radical change relies on radical institutional changes that have replaced public regulation and collective action mechanisms with self-regulating market rules. This private-interest-led regime that relies on de-institutionalization and de-socialization of governance structures (regulation, supervision, and incentivization of markets) has led to the 2007–2008 global financial crisis that we have not yet recovered from. This path that the evolution of societies takes at the global level regarding ecological and social issues is an unsustainable and unviable way of organizing society and economy. Environmental and resource depletion and hysteresis of inequalities are some of the consequences of this episode. Thus, the transition of market economies to a sustainable society calls for an institutional revolution that would offer an alternative organization of economies through collective action, capable of enabling an eco-transition towards a livable future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Collective Action; Ecological Economics; Institutions; Sustainability,,,"Almawi, Andréa, Alternative Financing for a Sustainable Energy Transition: An Institutionalist Perspective, Journal of Economic Issues, 58, 2, pp. 487-494, (2024); Barredo-Zurriarain, Juan, Fallacies of market-friendly financial regulation conducted by the Federal Reserve in the 1990s and 2000s, Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, 43, 4, pp. 540-575, (2020); Labour Reallocation and Productivity Dynamics Financial Causes Real Consequences, (2016); undefined, (2015); Guide on Climate Related and Environmental Risks, (2020); A Moment of Historic Danger It is Still 90 Seconds to Midnight 2024 Doomsday Clock Statement, (2024); Ngfs Climate Scenarios for Central Banks and Supervisors, (2021); Steele, Graham S., CONFRONTING THE ""CLIMATE LEHMAN MOMENT"": THE CASE FOR MACROPRUDENTIAL CLIMATE REGULATION, Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy, 30, 1, pp. 109-157, (2020); Stiroh, Kevin J., How did bank holding companies prosper in the 1990s?, Journal of Banking and Finance, 24, 11, pp. 1703-1745, (2000); Ülgen, Faruk, Financing the future: sustainable economic and environmental transition through sustainable regulation, pp. 136-153, (2025)",,Routledge,,00213624,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006910364,

Findings suggested that environmental risk disclosure was low for the year considered. The range of environmental risks listed as material and strategic, across the companies, was extremely limited, with climate risks being identified the most. The types of environmental risks disclosed by these JSE companies were found to be well aligned with the top global risks listed by the World Economic Forum in 2020. With continued and increasing global environmental degradation, together with pressure from company stakeholders, as well as recently introduced international and national guidance, it could be expected that environmental risk disclosure will improve among top-listed JSE companies.

However, in most coastal regions, empowerment challenges for vulnerable people, especially coastal women, have remained prevalent. With the increasing appetite for BE resources, concerns have been raised about whether women's exclusion in BE sectors will not perpetuated, amidst the masculine domination of employment and leadership opportunities in the BE sectors. A case study of India is utilized to explore the literature and understand the perceptions and attitudes towards women's employment and leadership in the BE. This study sourced literature and utilized a bibliometric analysis technique to analyze 1768 articles. The aim was to: (i) explore research trends, (ii) scientifically map literature, key themes, and networks, and (iii) highlight perceptions and attitudes towards women's employment and leadership in the BE of India. Findings revealed that research on the BE and gender issues increased. Research citations and impact are low or have plummeted. Most publications on women-related issues in the BE are in low-impact journals. Publishing gender-specific research in top journals increases the authors'/research's impact and visibility. Multi-country collaborations on WE in the BE are low. Historical gender stereotypes and negative attitudes are critical in determining women's employment and leadership in BE sectors. Themes/concepts that promote sustainable avenues for WE in the BE, such as sustainable development, blue equity and justice, uplifting of women's status, shared gender roles, and gender relations, are just emerging or declining. Socioeconomic empowerment through financial literacy is considered critical to WE in the BE. Promoting coastal WE requires grounded transdisciplinary research approaches/techniques. Positive indicators for women's employment are emerging, mostly in service sectors, some coastal nearshore and onshore activities. Employment opportunities are enormous in long-established sectors, but social sexism on gender roles persists. Institutional mechanisms, targeting WE and gender equity in the BE, are being streamlined. Emphasizing women's studies, community participation, and WE, especially in vulnerable regions like the Bay of Bengal, are recommended strategies. Although policy and research efforts to empower women in decision-making are increasing, women's input/relevance in decision-making is abysmal. Transformative indicators have hardly translated into holistic women's employment and leadership. A simplistic women empowerment pathway (WEP) (comprising five steps) has been developed to aid WE in the BE. Holistic WE could only be achieved in a phased and continuous manner. This should begin by redefining what WE in the BE must entail. This can help generate micro-level vulnerabilities, viable WE opportunities, and holistic inclusion mechanisms that could be replicated in other jurisdictions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bibliometric Analysis; Blue Economy; India; Perceptions And Attitudes; Women Empowerment Pathway; Women's Employment And Leadership,,"This paper forms part of the E4LIFE International Doctoral Research Program requirements.

Findings: The results show that attitude (ATT), subjective norm (SN), GK and SMPU have a significant relationship with behavioral intention toward green investments (BIGI), but there is no relation between perceived behavioral control (PBC) and BIGI. As for the moderating effect, SMPU moderates the relationship between ATT, SN, GK and BIGI, but not between PBC and BIGI. Practical implications: The study provides some implications for investment providers, service providers and policymakers.

Sustainable finance is defined as the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into investment decision-making processes, encompassing two primary categories: green finance, which refers to established environmentally sustainable practices, and transition finance, which facilitates private investments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a climate-neutral economy. The text references the European Union’s non-binding recommendations from June 13, 2023, which urge financial and non-financial entities to leverage these frameworks to support transition finance initiatives. The narrative subsequently shifts to sustainable insurance, characterized as a strategic approach that promotes accountability across the whole value chain. This includes proactive stakeholder engagement to identify, assess, manage, and monitor risks associated with ESG factors while capitalizing on associated opportunities. The overarching aim of sustainable insurance is to mitigate risks, improve business performance, and foster contributions to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Despite its potential, the insurance sector in Africa remains markedly underdeveloped, as evidenced by low penetration rates. According to the World Bank Group's findings published in December 2024, Africa is among the most unequal regions globally, with over half of its countries reporting Gini index values exceeding 40. This inequality stems from structural factors such as ethnicity, gender, and education, exacerbated by market distortions that favour a limited number of stakeholders. Moreover, the introduction highlights ongoing land and mineral rights disputes as significant contributors to these disparities. It posits that superficial solutions are inadequate; a more nuanced and comprehensive approach is essential for effectively diagnosing and addressing systemic limitations. Additionally, the challenges posed by climate change threaten the livelihoods of vulnerable populations reliant on agriculture and fishing, further disrupting natural capital and diminishing income-generating capabilities. This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how sustainable finance and insurance can effectively confront these pressing challenges and serve as catalysts for transformative development across Africa. The handbook draws on contributions from diverse experts, providing critical insights aimed at enhancing financial inclusion and promoting sustainable economic growth within the region. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation To Climate Change; Climate Change; Economic Emancipation; Environmental Stewardship And Social Responsibility; Financial Inclusion; Land Reform; Mining Rights; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Finance,,,"Overview of Sustainable Finance, (2024); World Bank, (2024); Sibindi, Athenia Bongani, Information and Communication Technology Adoption and Life Insurance Market Development: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 15, 12, (2022); Principles for Sustainable Insurance Strengthening the Insurance Industrys Contribution to Building Resilient Inclusive Sustainable Communities and Economies, (2024)",,Springer Nature,,21987262; 21987270,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003837193,

Using lease transactions of office and retail spaces in London, combined with ESG scores from the Refinitiv database, we analyse whether ESG-conscious firms are more likely to choose green-labelled properties, and how their WTP for such spaces varies according to their ESG profiles. Our findings indicate that publicly listed companies, which are more likely to emphasise ESG considerations, are more likely to occupy BREEAM-certified offices. Office tenants with higher Governance scores also exhibit a stronger preference for BREEAM-certified buildings. In contrast, these relationships are not observed in the retail sector. Although tenants’ overall ESG scores are not significantly associated with WTP for green-labelled properties in either market, retailers with strong Governance scores are willing to pay a premium for BREEAM-certified spaces. The link between tenants’ ESG scores and their demand for green-certified buildings appears to be stronger in recent years, reflecting the growing emphasis on ESG considerations. Our findings underscore the diverse priorities of tenants across the real estate market and offer valuable insights for property owners in developing effective leasing strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Commercial Real Estate; Green Buildings; Rent Premiums; Sustainability Preferences; Tenants’ Esg,,,"Akhtyrska, Yana, The effectiveness of climate change regulations in the commercial real estate market, Energy Policy, 185, (2024); Alp, Aysun, Structural Shifts in Credit Rating Standards, Journal of Finance, 68, 6, pp. 2435-2470, (2013); Baghai, Ramin P., Have rating agencies become more conservative?

This has not always been the case. This chapter explores how the introduction and growth of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria for sustainable investing have elevated the topic of climate change as a business risk and how it influenced its measurement at the firm level accordingly. By reviewing how climate measures have been captured and evolved through time at an influential ESG rating agency, MSCI Inc., the chapter highlights that the tools for managing climate change such as carbon accounts are a product of historical and social construction, influenced by institutional developments, the rating agencies, and the investors that use ratings alike. This also highlights that there is not one “true” measure of climate risk and that climate change assessments always need to be interpreted in the context of dominant market logics and idiosyncratic preferences. The chapter discusses how cognition of this can help to assess different risk interpretations and use cases, and how these may influence investors thinking about climate change management at the firm level. It also discusses the role of risk reporting frameworks such as the TCFD recommendations in creating more consistency in assessments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Barko, Tamas, Shareholder Engagement on Environmental, Social, and Governance Performance, Journal of Business Ethics, 180, 2, pp. 777-812, (2022); Bebbington, Jan, Carbon trading: Accounting and reporting issues, European Accounting Review, 17, 4, pp. 697-717, (2008); Berg, Florian, Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings*, Review of Finance, 26, 6, pp. 1315-1344, (2022); U S Environmental Social and Governance Investing 2023 Regulation and Legislation; Chambers, David L., To divest or to engage?

Therefore, we aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by identifying the impact of ESG dimensions on the engagement of Generation Z employees. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the literature review findings, we formulated a conceptual model to illustrate the relationship between ESG dimensions and employee engagement. We conducted a confirmatory analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM CFA) on a sample of 207 Generation Z employees to validate the proposed model. We collected the data in June 2024. Findings: We designed a quantitative study to test a model depicting the relationship between ESG dimensions and employee engagement. The results indicated a strong influence of social and corporate governance-related ESG on the engagement of Generation Z employees. The study did not show a relationship between environment-related ESG and the engagement of Generation Z individuals. Originality/value: The study bridges the gap in our understanding of the link between ESG and the engagement of Generation Z employees. It suggests the necessity to further investigate the specific impact of individual ESG practices on employee engagement. We recommend expanding the scope of future research to examine the components of the constructs studied as well as the mediators and moderators of the relationship between ESG and employee engagement for Generation Z employees. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Employee Engagement; Esg; Generation Z,,,"National Conference on Innovative Business Management Practices in 21st Century, (2018); Bahadır, Oğuzhan, Does Company Information Environment Affect ESG–Financial Performance Relationship?

In the business context, companies which report their sustainability activities are sometimes accused of greenwashing. Although research from various disciplines has shown that the image of homo economicus is a myth and a large number of enterprises have recognized the importance of the issue and developed their approaches further—from performing corporate social responsibility measures as an “add-on” to more integrated concepts that do not perceive purpose and profits as mutually exclusive objectives but an integrated “add-in”—the narrative of business as a profit-driven inhuman sector seems to prevail in society. This is of concern because narratives influence our beliefs, emotions, and behavior. In this article, we illustrate that adhering to the story of homo economicus is harmful in multiple ways. Drawing from insights from fields such as business ethics and interpersonal neurobiology, we take a particularly closer look at its negative effects for the well-being of individuals, by exploring different concepts of the self. At the same time, those concepts provide new perspectives such as the relational aspects of an individual’s mental life. By integrating those insights, the paradigm of “all one” emerges and with it a new narrative of and about business which surpasses the mere alignment of individual and societal well-being but rather strives to harmonize the well-being of individuals in a manner that the well-being of society grows out of it. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business Ethics; Business Paradigms; Collective Well-being; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Dealing With Complexity; Homo Economicus Myth; Human Flourishing; Interpersonal Neurobiology; Narratives In Business; Relational Self Concept; Sustainability In Business; Sustainable Business Transformation; Well-being Of Individuals,,,"Anderson, Elizabeth S., Beyond homo economicus: New developments in theories of social norms, Philosophy and Public Affairs, 29, 2, pp. 170-200, (2000); Critical Realism Essential Readings, (1998); De Anima on the Soul, (1986); Auster, Ellen R., Values and Poetic Organizations: Beyond Value Fit Toward Values Through Conversation, Journal of Business Ethics, 113, 1, pp. 39-49, (2013); Barbier, Edward B., The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development, Environmental Conservation, 14, 2, pp. 101-110, (1987); Narratives Imperatives and Moral Reasoning Working Paper 24798 National Bureau of Economic Research; Cambridge University Press, (1998); Possibility of Naturalism, (2025); Anxiety of Influence A Theory of Poetry, (1973); Social Responsibilities of the Businessman, (1953)",,Springer Nature,,21967075; 21967083,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001515963,

The sea, including the sustainable exploitation of natural resources and maritime activities, is cross-cutting the National 2030 Strategy for Smart Specialization (NSSS2030), and is the foundation of the National Ocean Strategy 2021–2030 (NOS2030). Therefore, Portugal has great interest, but also challenges, in the knowledge of ocean processes, monitoring of their environmental status, maritime spatial planning, and their role in sustainable development and economic growth. In this study, a participatory workshop with stakeholders from diverse ocean sectors and across the value chain was carried out to co-identify the main needs and challenges of the ocean sector in Portugal and analyze the alignment of these identified needs and challenges with the NSSS2030, the NOS2023, the EU-Roadmap for the Blue Bioeconomy and the European Green Deal. Through a two-stage workshop, the interested parties provided 101 topics for information needs and challenges for the present and near future (5-year period) to identify priority areas for Portugal's ocean sector. Data analysis involved categorizing workshop content into ocean-related themes and PESTEL categories (Policy, Economy, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal), a framework used to analyze the external macro-environmental factors that can impact an organization or industry. The analysis identified missing data, information needs, and public policy challenges as the stakeholder's most relevant issues. Other needs are related to specialized training and capacity building, funding mechanisms, and open industry-academia relationships. The insights provided from this participatory process revealed common ground with European ocean sector challenges and needs. The national perception of knowledge gaps and emerging challenges should be addressed for effective implementation of the NOS2030 and the NSSS2030 and, ultimately, contribute to the next strategic framework design for ocean economy boosting at the EU, national, and regional levels. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Data management; Innovation; Ocean economy; Participatory; Policy frameworks; Technology,Data quality; Information management; Marine industry; Strategic planning; Blue economies; Economy sectors; Exclusive economic zones; Innovation; Ocean economy; Participatory; Policy framework; Portugal; Sustainable exploitation; Technology; Bioeconomy; data management; economic growth; Exclusive Economic Zone; participatory approach; policy approach; stakeholder; strategic approach; sustainable development; academia; article; capacity building; data analysis; diagnosis; economic aspect; economic development; environmental factor; European Union; human; information processing; knowledge gap; natural resource; perception; public policy; specialization; workshop; environmental protection; Europe; Conservation of Natural Resources; Sustainable Development,,"Aracri, Simona, Soft Robots for Ocean Exploration and Offshore Operations: A Perspective, Soft Robotics, 8, 6, pp. 625-639, (2021); Simulating Social Complexity A Handbook, (2013); Investigacao Qualitativa Em Educacao, (1994); Carapuço, Mafalda, Portuguese European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and Water Column Observatory Initiative, Frontiers in Marine Science, 9, (2022); Research Methods in Education, (2007); Costa, Cátia Miriam, Building multiscalar sustainable ocean governance: How do global perspectives interact with the Portuguese national approach?, Heliyon, 10, 7, (2024); Costello, Mark John, A census of marine biodiversity knowledge, resources, and future challenges, PLOS ONE, 5, 8, (2010); Educational Research Planning Conducting and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research, (2008); Custódio, Marco, Prioritizing ecosystem services for marine management through stakeholder engagement, Ocean and Coastal Management, 225, (2022); Depellegrin, Daniel, Innovating the Blue Economy: A Novel Approach to Stakeholder Landscape Mapping of the Atlantic Area Sea Basin, Frontiers in Marine Science, 9, (2022)",,Academic Press,,03014797; 10958630,,JEVMA,40315651.0,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003743796,

It asks how the EU has been dealing with the allocation of resources to foster the sustainability transition, how the additional transformations required by the 'climate emergency' will be financed and which actors (businesses, governments, citizens) will pay and how. Looking at how the EU has been managing this over time, through changes in the Environment Action Programmes, Structural Funds, or the Multiannual Financial Framework, this book examines policy priorities and analyses the different instruments proposed as part of this evolving context, including market support instruments for renewable energies and the creation of new instruments, such as Climate Awareness Bonds. It also highlights new developments, such as the debate on the role of environmental taxes, or the uneven development across Member States of green financial instruments. This book presents an evolving puzzle into the limited possibilities of the EU to deploy resources that contribute to the overarching goal of achieving a low-carbon economy and illustrates the need for acceptance towards changes and compromises that are required from all affected stakeholders.

The paper also examines how bank ownership, market capitalization, and profitability affect reporting quality. Sustainability reporting is at the core of the corporate sustainability environment. Two hundred twenty-four bank-year sustainability reports issued by 34 banks from 2015–16 to 2022–23 of the Indian banking industry were coded using content analysis techniques. The study uses a 23-indicator quality assessment scale developed by Pistoni et al. (Corp Soc Responsib Environ Manage 25(4):489–507, 2018). The scale measures Background, Assurance and Reliability, Content, and Form of reports. The study reveals that while quality has improved, there is a need for further efforts to achieve high-quality and consistent sustainability reporting. Form and background areas are well addressed, but report content and assurance need improvement. The findings imply a link between market capitalization and QSR, as larger banks report better. However, ownership structure and profitability do not affect the quality of reporting. This study facilitates banks and stakeholders to integrate sustainability issues. This study is one of the initial attempts to analyze the quality of sustainability reports published by Indian banks and adds to the expanding domain of quality research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Indian Banks; Quality Of Sustainability Reporting; Reporting Regulations; Sustainability Reporting; Banking; Ownership; Profitability; Regulatory Approach; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Trend Analysis; India,banking; ownership; profitability; regulatory approach; stakeholder; sustainability; trend analysis; India,,"De La Cuesta-González, Marta, Analysis of social performance in the Spanish financial industry through public data.

The financial sector's role in this context has gained significant attention over the past decades. Although theoretical studies are on the rise, few scholars consolidate both theory and practice. This study addresses this gap through comprehensive bibliometric analysis, mapping the research landscape in the finance-sustainability field, and encompassing both optimistic and skeptical perspectives. It reviews and synthesizes key theoretical and empirical literature focusing on most recent studies. Specifically, it emphasizes broader aspects of financial development—depth, access, efficiency, and stability—in critically analyzing the economic, environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development, which are distinct yet highly interconnected. It further provides a detailed analysis of sustainable development theories, highlighting their shortcomings and future prospects. Particularly, this study identifies different dimensions, significant factors, and important indicators of sustainability which are vital for achieving and understanding long-term sustainable development.

One of the practices that might improve a company’s reputation is the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment criteria. In this research, using Natural Language Processing techniques like Sentiment Analysis and Word2Vec, we detected those ESG-related terms that the written press uses in news articles about companies. Thus, we have been able to discover and analyze those terms that improve sympathy toward companies, and those that worsen it. Our findings show that those terms related to sustainable development, good social practices and ethical governance improve the general public’s opinion of a company, while those related to greenwashing and socialwashing worsen it. Therefore, this methodology is valid for enabling companies to detect those terms that improve or worsen their reputation, and thus help them make decisions that improve their image. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Reputation; Esg; News; Nlp; Sentiment Analysis; Image Enhancement; Presses (machine Tools); Sustainable Development; Condition; Corporate Reputations; Environmental, Social And Governance; Financial Results; Improve-a; Investment Criteria; Language Processing Techniques; Natural Languages; News; Sentiment Analysis","Image enhancement; Presses (machine tools); Sustainable development; Condition; Corporate reputations; Environmental, social and governance; Financial results; IMPROVE-A; Investment criteria; Language processing techniques; Natural languages; News; Sentiment analysis",,"Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); Banawan, Michelle P., Shared Language: Linguistic Similarity in an Algebra Discussion Forum, Computers, 12, 3, (2023); Brooks, Chris J., The effects of environmental, social and governance disclosures and performance on firm value: A review of the literature in accounting and finance, British Accounting Review, 50, 1, pp. 1-15, (2018); Chun, Rosa, Corporate reputation: Meaning and measurement, International Journal of Management Reviews, 7, 2, pp. 91-109, (2005); Cotizacion De Euro Stoxx 50® Indice Resumen Rentabilidad Dividendo, (2023); Drivers of Greenwashing, (2011); Demšar, Janez, Orange: Data mining toolbox in python, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 14, pp. 2349-2353, (2013); Esg Sustainable Finance Data Skills and Capacity Building Directory, (2020); Fatemi, Ali M., ESG performance and firm value: The moderating role of disclosure, Global Finance Journal, 38, pp. 45-64, (2018); Friede, Gunnar, ESG and financial performance: aggregated evidence from more than 2000 empirical studies, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 5, 4, pp. 210-233, (2015)",,Springer,,18695469; 18695450,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186141070,

Here we estimate the relationship between company size and four environmental indicators to understand the environmental performance of nearly 6500 companies, building on the concept of allometric scaling and using Thomson Reuters EIKON data for the year 2018. We highlight that carbon dioxide emissions, energy use, water and waste production scale with the size according to a power law. This can be used as a benchmark to assess unambiguously a company’s environmental performance. We find that the adopted Environmental, Social & Governance rating is uncorrelated with the environmental performance. Our results suggest that a fair and effective environmental policy should consider the nature of the scaling relationship. Scaling laws suggest the existence of a nexus between an underlying network and corporate metabolism, whose understanding would help in discerning the determinants of environmental impacts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Emission; Energy Use; Environmental Economics; Environmental Indicator; Firm Size; Sustainability,carbon emission; energy use; environmental economics; environmental indicator; firm size; sustainability,"The authors would like to thank Noam Abadi for his reviewing contribution and Professor Luis Bettencourt for his valuable and regarded comments which helped us improve the paper.

The assessment covers the 60 largest steel companies by volume, accounting for more than 60 % of global steel production. Data on company-level greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and emission reduction measures were collected from publicly available documents. We found that only 30 companies have their own greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of varying timeframes between 2025 and 2060. Even when excluding the 15 Chinese state-owned companies that are under the national 2060 net zero target, 15 companies had no emission reduction targets. Twenty-one companies had long-term targets (2040 or after), of which 18 were net zero emission targets; all but one also had interim targets. If all climate targets identified among the 60 companies are achieved, annual CO<inf>2</inf> emissions for the 60 companies could be reduced by up to 12 % by 2030 and up to 39 % by 2050 in comparison to a baseline scenario. Assuming a gradual increase in global crude steel demand from 1.9 Gt in 2019 to 2.5 Gt in 2050 and assuming similar trends for the rest of the global iron and steel sector as observed for the 60 companies, we estimate that the current ambition of the global iron and steel sector on emission reductions would lead to a reduction of 38 % to 53 % by 2050 from 2019 levels (3.4 GtCO<inf>2</inf> to 1.6–2.1 GtCO<inf>2</inf>), or compared to a 32 % to 43 % reduction in a baseline scenario in 2050. Steel companies are also lagging in setting clear emission reduction plans to achieve their targets. We found that 14 out of the 30 steel producers with targets did not provide an emission reduction plan. The most popular measures amongst the 16 companies that identified at least one measure to achieve their target in their emission reduction plans were hydrogen-based DRI (n = 14), enhanced use of renewable electricity (n = 13) and Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCU/S) for blast furnaces (n = 9). While it is encouraging that the steel companies have started acting toward long-term deep decarbonisation, our findings suggest that there is a long way ahead and the action needs to be accelerated considerably. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Climate Action; Decarbonisation; Environmental, Social, And Governance (esg); Iron And Steel Industry; Paris Agreement",,"Funding text 1: This research was supported by IKEA Foundation (grant no.

However, a vast amount of literature has produced conflicting findings about the importance of debt capital (leverage) as a factor in sustainability reporting (SR). This is the first meta-analysis reconciling the mixed results of 85 single country studies containing 131 effect sizes across 24,482 firms conducted over past three decades (1999–2022) investigating the influence of leverage on SR. The study emphasizes the significance of contextualizing research by identifying the macro-environmental elements modifying debt's impact on SR, through the use of the institutional theory. Eleven country variables were tested on the collected dataset, spread across 36 countries. Design/methodology/approach: Meta-analysis technique for aggregation of existing extant empirical work. Continuous and categorical variable-based moderator analysis to demystify the influence of country characteristics affecting the leverage–SR relationship. Findings: Results show positive significant impact of debt capital providers on SR. Country's level of development, GDP, extent of capital constraints in a country, financial sector development within a nation, country governance factors and corruption levels, country's culture, number of sustainability reporting instruments operational in a country and geographical location proved to be significant moderators. Research limitations/implications: The study details relevant meaningful research gaps, worthy of uptake by researchers to produce targeted research. Practical implications: Governments must increasingly go beyond their mandated disclosure role and acknowledge the important institutional factors that have contributed to the expansion of ESG reporting through the creation of nation-specific tools, incentive structures and disclosure-encouraging regulations. To secure a steady flow of funding and prevent negative effects on company value and cost of capital in the midst of prolonged global economic upheaval, businesses must address the information requirements of lenders. The limited total effect size emphasizes the necessity for debt providers to step up their ESG activism and exercise their maximum power and potential in stimulating extensive SR firm-level practices.

This study of disclosure experiences aims to explore the role of co-evolutionary relationships in the Taxonomy’s effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: Co-evolution theory implies a dynamic interplay among sustainable finance stakeholders (SFSs), through adjustment to, impact on and operationalisation of the Taxonomy. Corporate disclosure experiences, including those of financial institutions and related SFS experiences, may reveal co-evolutionary processes. With significant Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), Irish SFSs provide contextual insight. Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of Irish SFSs capture inaugural corporate Taxonomy disclosure experiences. Findings: A thematic analysis reveals six co-evolutionary processes that facilitate Taxonomy implementation in pursuit of policy objectives: [1] cross-functional reporting; [2] iterative pre-empting and addressing compliance issues; [3] regulation as a catalyst for co-evolution; [4] advanced capacity building; [5] stakeholder adaptation and [6] graduated use of ESG data. Implications for sustainability policy development and management are significant. Practical implications: Whilst limited to just one EU jurisdiction, given limited prior empirical evidence for sustainable finance regulations from co-evolutionary perspectives, this study highlights a catalytic, yet precautionary role for co-evolution in their transformation effectiveness. As such, they must take account of their potential to stimulate co-evolution and to nurture it in pursuit of their policy objectives. Social implications: The findings of this study add to a small, but growing body of academic literature on the Taxonomy Regulation, which suggests that a co-evolutionary lens is important for gaining a comprehensive understanding of its early-stage dynamics. From an implementation perspective, the qualitative data reveals actionable implications for regulators and policymakers, such as building capacity, better anticipation of outcomes and investment in data infrastructure. Originality/value: Unlike existing analyses of disclosures, this study offers a co-evolutionary lens on Taxonomy contributions to sustainable development through qualitative accounts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Co-evolution; Corporate Disclosure; Eu Taxonomy; Greenwashing; Sustainability Policy; Sustainability Reporting; Sustainable Finance; Thematic Analysis,,This research was funded by the Technological University of Dublin through the Business Partners Part-time Fee Scheme Award.

It explains the tenets of sustainable Islamic banking by looking at the relationship between banks and ESG and climate-related factors. This study examines corporate finance mechanisms via commercial Islamic banking, highlighting noninterest-based loans with a focus on sustainability, social responsibility, and the environment as cutting-edge financial instruments. Among the topics examined are green corporate deposits, syndicated financing, project finance, and sustainable trade finance, as well as instruments like sustainable shipping letters of credit. As part of its aim to boost responsible financial practices and ethical investments, the chapter highlights how sustainability principles can be integrated into Islamic banking. The contribution of Islamic banking to corporate financing offers a range of environmentally friendly and sustainable financial products that are in line with moral values as determined by the Shari'ah. This covers consequences linked to sustainability as well as effects on the environment and society. This study goes into the field of investment banking and demonstrates how moral and responsible investment choices can be made by applying the principles of Islamic finance. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the crucial role Islamic banking plays in maintaining financial stability and resilience. It presents arguments that Islamic banking can be a catalyst for positive change, by aligning financial practices with ethical principles so that global banking becomes more sustainable and responsible. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",And Governance (esg); Environmental; Ethical Investment; Green Financial Products; Islamic Banking; Social; Sustainable Finance,,,"Bbva Leads the World S First Green Syndicated Financing in Term Loan Format, (2017); Sustainable Shipment Letter of Credit A Financing Solution to Incentivise Sustainable Commodity Trade, (2014); Global Landscape of Climate Finance A Decade of Data, (2022); Banking on A Low Carbon Future, (2020); Guide to Corporate Sustainability, (2014); Principles for Responsible Banking, (2019); Report of the Standing Committee on Finance, (2022)",,Emerald Publishing,,,9781835499078; 9781835499061,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210109497,

The exponential growth in literature seeking to delineate its conceptualization, mechanisms, and enablers underscores its significance and implications. However, the varied scholarly contributions have also given rise to persistent discrepancies and a subjective-objective dichotomy within the field, necessitating a comprehensive review. To address this gap, we conducted a thorough bibliometric analysis employing citation, co-citation, and co-occurrence techniques. Our study enriches the theoretical underpinnings by examining its thematic nuances, underlying nomological networks, and evolutionary trends. Specifically, our findings unveil a notable shift toward subjective evaluation shaped by temporal perspectives. Moreover, we discern an increasing influence of psychological variables in shaping individuals' subjective assessments of their financial well-being, extending beyond traditional cognitive and objective dimensions. Additionally, our analysis underscores the pivotal role of financial socialization, highlighting the impact of social and environmental factors on subjective perceptions.

Based on data collected from 82 banks in the banking industry across nine emerging Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries from 2015 to 2021, the results indicate that heightened competitive pressure compels banks to enhance their efforts in environmental and social initiatives. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between greater Board gender diversity (BGD) and improved environmental and social performance. Finally, the results indicate that the negative impact of market power on environmental and social performance is less pronounced in banks with higher BGD, those operating in countries with a better institutional environment, and in state-owned banks. In contrast, the negative impact is more pronounced in Islamic banks.

Specifically, it examines (1) the effectiveness of sustainability performance communication framing in shaping traveler’s behavioral intentions, (2) the mediating role of perceived commitment to sustainability, and (3) the moderating effect of the level of sustainability performance communicated. The findings of the four experiments conducted revealed that communicating sustainability performance is more effective than not reporting it in determining travelers’ behavioral intentions. Furthermore, an enhancement framing is more effective when communicating sustainability performance than a reduction framing. We also found that tourism provider’s commitment to sustainability explains the impact of sustainability performance communication framing on behavioral intentions. Furthermore, we found that communicating a moderate level of sustainability performance in enhancement framing and a high level in reduction framing is effective. The study provides implications for theory and practice in developing effective sustainability communication. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Message Framing; Perceived Commitment; Sustainability Communication; Sustainability Performance; Sustainable Consumption; Performance Assessment; Sustainability; Tourism; Tourism Development; Travel Behavior,performance assessment; sustainability; tourism; tourism development; travel behavior,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by the Zhejiang Soft Science Programme (Grant No. 2022C35053) funded by the Science Technology Department of Zhejiang Province, China and research grant provided by Rennes School of Business, France.","Aksoy, Lerzan M., Social innovation in service: a conceptual framework and research agenda, Journal of Service Management, 30, 3, pp. 429-448, (2019); Albayrak, Tahir, Prioritisation of the hotel attributes according to their influence on satisfaction: A comparison of two techniques, Tourism Management, 46, pp. 43-50, (2015); Amin, Saqib, Blessing or curse: The role of diversity matters in stimulating or relegating environmental sustainability—a global perspective via renewable and non-renewable energy, Renewable Energy, 189, pp. 927-937, (2022); Balaji, M.

However, there is limited scientific evidence about their economic viability and equity impacts. We examined English-language peer-reviewed studies, published between 2000 and 2021, which undertook economic evaluations of NbS for DRR and CCA. Based on our results, 71 % of studies indicated that NbS have consistently proven to be a cost-effective approach to mitigating hazards and 24 % of studies found NbS cost-effective under certain conditions. The ecosystem-based interventions most frequently found effective in mitigating hazards are associated with mangroves (80 %), forests (77 %), and coastal ecosystems (73 %). Studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of NbS and engineering-based solutions for mitigating certain hazards showed that NbS are no less effective than engineering-based solutions. Among these studies, 65 % found that NbS are always more effective in attenuating hazards compared to engineering-based solutions and 26 % found that NbS are partially more effective. Our findings illustrate a range of factors, including the geographic locations of the NbS analyzed, their contribution to the restoration and increase of biodiversity, their property rights structure, their source of financing, and the economic methodologies employed to assess cost-effectiveness and distributional effects. The geographic location of the NbS observations included in this analysis was examined considering global projected temperature and precipitation changes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change Adaptation; Disaster Risk Reduction; Nature-based Solutions; Social Justice; Socioeconomic Benefits; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Disasters; Economic Analysis; Economic And Social Effects; Ecosystems; Environmental Regulations; Forestry; Hazards; Climate Change Adaptation; Disaster Risk Reductions; Economic Viability; Framework Agreements; Geographic Location; National-policy; Nature-based Solution; Scientific Evidence; Social Justice; Socio-economic Benefits; Cost Effectiveness; Adaptive Management; Air Temperature; Climate Change; Disaster Management; Precipitation (climatology); Social Justice; Socioeconomic Impact; Adaptation; Biodiversity; Coastal Waters; Controlled Study; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Disaster; Disaster Mitigation; Disease Management; Economic Evaluation; Forest; Human; Mangrove; Precipitation; Review; Temperature,Biodiversity; Climate change; Disasters; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental regulations; Forestry; Hazards; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reductions; Economic viability; Framework agreements; Geographic location; National-policy; Nature-based solution; Scientific evidence; Social justice; Socio-economic benefits; Cost effectiveness; adaptive management; air temperature; climate change; disaster management; precipitation (climatology); social justice; socioeconomic impact; adaptation; biodiversity; coastal waters; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; disaster; disaster mitigation; disease management; economic evaluation; forest; human; mangrove; precipitation; review; temperature,"Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Marta Vicarelli reports that financial support was provided by the University of Massachusetts Amherst; Marta Vicarelli and Jaroslav Mysiak report that financial support was provided by the European Union's Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021-2027) under grant agreement No. 10106064.

Design/methodology/approach: Starting from the analysis of the more relevant literature on the topic, this paper describes an illustrative real case through interviews with the credit department of an Italian bank that has adopted a specific sustainability approach. This paper discusses this case in the context of the outlined theoretical background to explore the trends and challenges of ESG integration. The case study allows us to evaluate and expand our theoretical framework, leading to a greater understanding of the complex phenomenon under investigation. Findings: Based on the analysis of the literature combined with the insights that emerged from the experience of the real case, this study shows that there are three primary factors to consider: data issues, competencies and workflow. This study outlines an enhanced knowledge management framework displaying the complexity emerging from the integration of ESG into a bank’s credit department and identify the best practices to pursue. Practical implications: Given the increasing pressure toward the incorporation of ESG factors into the banking sector, the practical implications of the study are relevant as they provide guidelines for action. Specifically, the practical problems highlighted by the real case, like the priority on themes such as questionnaires, the need for ad hoc commissions and workflow, drive the attention of decision-makers on key aspects to effectively adopt an advanced knowledge management approach aimed at improving the ESG integration. Considering the effect of the banking system on the economy, the best practices this study has identified can also have a positive impact on society as a whole. Originality/value: The proposed enhanced knowledge management framework offers a guideline to orchestrate ESG integration into banks’ credit departments, considering the increasing need to frame a sustainability-oriented strategic approach that emerges from academic and practical enquiries. This research represents an initial attempt to investigate the integration of ESG factors in the banking system through the lens of knowledge management. The strategic nature of the ESG approach clearly appears in a dynamic environment where stakeholder pressures and regulatory evolutions are strong. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking; Credit; Esg; Knowledge Management; Sustainability,,,"Abbas, Jawad, Impact of knowledge management practices on green innovation and corporate sustainable development: A structural analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 229, pp. 611-620, (2019); Ahmad, Nisar, Revisiting the impact of ESG on financial performance of FTSE350 UK firms: Static and dynamic panel data analysis, Cogent Business and Management, 8, 1, (2021); How is Credit Risk Affected by Esg Factors, (2021); Journal of Knowledge Management Practice, (2006); Argote, Linda M., The Mechanisms and Components of Knowledge Transfer: The Virtual Special Issue on Knowledge Transfer Within Organizations, Organization Science, 33, 3, pp. 1232-1249, (2022); Banagou, Maria, Relational climates moderate the effect of openness to experience on knowledge hiding: a two-country multi-level study, Journal of Knowledge Management, 25, 11, pp. 60-87, (2021); Systems Thinking and Viable Systems, (2023); Barile, Sergio, People, technology, and governance for sustainability: the contribution of systems and cyber-systemic thinking, Sustainability Science, 13, 5, pp. 1197-1208, (2018); Barile, Sergio, The viable systems approach and its contribution to the analysis of sustainable business behaviors, Systems Research and Behavioral Science, 31, 6, pp. 683-695, (2014); Climate Related Risk Drivers and their Transmission Channels, (2021)",,Emerald Publishing,,13673270,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192350686,

In the context of global changes, the insurance sector of Uzbekistan is faced with the need to adapt to international standards of sustainable development, which include environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects. The authors analyze the current state of the insurance market in Uzbekistan, emphasizing its positive dynamics in recent years, but note that the implementation of ESG principles is at an early stage. Key barriers include a lack of experience and knowledge in the ESG field, limited financial resources of insurance companies and lack of regulatory support. The article proposes strategic steps to deepen the integration of ESG principles into insurance practice, including the development of environmental insurance, increasing the financial literacy of the population and improving management transparency in insurance companies. In conclusion, it is emphasized that the introduction of ESG principles can significantly increase the competitiveness of insurance companies, strengthen their market positions and attract new partners, as well as contribute to the implementation of the national strategy for the transition to a green economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg; Insurance Market; Sustainable Development,,,"2023 Global Insurance Market Premiums Profitability Risk Assessment, (2024); Allianz Launches Digital Claims Hub and App, (2020); How Esg could Transform Insurance into A More Sustainable Sector, (2024); On Additional Measures on Digitalization of the Insurance Market and Development of Life Insurance Sphere, (2021); Disaster Property Insurance in Uzbekistan Overview and Recommendations, (2020); Esg Considerations Gaining Ground in Underwriting, (2023); Esg in Insurance Insured Emissions, (2023); Esg in Insurance Insured Emissions Strategy and Transformation, (2023); Esg Transformation Environmental Social and Governance Reporting in Insurance, (2022); Uzbekistan the First Insurance Compensation for Environmental Damage Was Paid, (2014)","Sang, Y.; Satyanaga, A.; Kuzmin, E.",EDP Sciences,,25550403; 22671242,9782759890163; 9782759890552; 9782759890644,,,English,Conference paper,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207308744,

However, only new guidelines, mandatory for many entities, including banks, will allow for comparing these reports, which will be of great importance mainly for investors. The forms of these reports were and still are different, difficult to compare in individual years, and difficult to compare between banks. The article aims to present the banks’ preparation for the new reporting rules based on the latest ESG reports. The research was conducted in four groups of commercial banks operating in Poland. These are the largest companies listed in the WIG Banks sub-index of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Gaps in the preparation of these banks for non-financial reporting were identified. The non-financial reports of the banks studied have significant information potential that can be used by various stakeholder groups, including investors, customers, employees, regulators, and local communities. However, the comparability of ESG reports is one of the key challenges faced by both reporting banks and users of these reports. The research results can be used both in scientific works and by bank representatives to improve non-financial reports. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banks’ Challenges; Commercial Banks; Csrd Directive; Esg; Green Financing; Non-financial Reporting; Banking; Commercial Activity; Green Economy; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development; Poland [central Europe],banking; commercial activity; green economy; stakeholder; sustainable development; Poland [Central Europe],,"Jeucken, Marcel H.A., Sustainable Finance and Banking: The Financial Sector and the Future of the Planet, pp. 1-318, (2010); Scholtens, Bert, Corporate social responsibility in the international banking industry, Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 2, pp. 159-175, (2009); Zyznarska-Dworczak, Beata, Sustainability performance efficiency in the banking sector, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja, 36, 3, (2023); In Political Science Law Finance Economics Turism, (2016); Gillan, Stuart L., Firms and social responsibility: A review of ESG and CSR research in corporate finance, Journal of Corporate Finance, 66, (2021); Sobhani, Farid Ahammad, Sustainability disclosure in annual reports and websites: A study of the banking industry in Bangladesh, Journal of Cleaner Production, 23, 1, pp. 75-85, (2012); Nobanee, Haitham, Voluntary corporate governance disclosure and bank performance: evidence from an emerging market, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 22, 4, pp. 702-719, (2022); Ellili, Nejla Ould Daoud, Impact of economic, environmental, and corporate social responsibility reporting on financial performance of UAE banks, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 25, 5, pp. 3967-3983, (2023); Menassa, Elie, Determinants of corporate social responsibility disclosures of UAE national banks: a multi-perspective approach, Social Responsibility Journal, 16, 5, pp. 631-654, (2020); Georgiadou, Effrosyni S., Exploring strategic CSR communication on UAE banks' corporate websites, Corporate Communications, 25, 3, pp. 413-428, (2020)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207352124,

The study employed multifaceted empirical techniques, including Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR), Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), and Dumitrescu and Hurlin (D-H), augmented with robustness tests over the period 2000 to 2021. The results indicate that digitalization augments energy transition and green finance to attain environmental sustainability. However, moving toward higher quantiles (4th, 6th, and 8th), the total impact of energy transition and digitalization is diminished. Besides that, a bidirectional causal relationship was reported running from green finance and digitalization to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

In the light of this context, our paper focuses specifically on banks and is framed by the following overarching question: to what extent have banks identified, integrated, measured, and disclosed their dependency and exposure to ecosystem services (ES)? The literature on finance and biodiversity provides various arguments highlighting the urgency and significance of understanding and disclosing banks' ES risk exposure. Despite numerous public and/or private initiatives, banks have been slow to evaluate and integrate their dependency on ES, and related risks, into their operations and performance. Using data from the ten largest European banks, we estimate that for every dollar of equity holding, 26 cents are potentially exposed to high ES dependencies. This figure should be regarded as a lower estimate of the total banks' exposure to ES dependency. To make progress, we argue that banks must become champions of ES to ensure their own resilience and financial sustainability. Governance plays a key role, and we suggest several measures to accelerate this transition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dependency; Ecosystems Services; European Banks; Governance; Value At Risk; Banking; Biodiversity; Ecosystem Service; Governance Approach; Risk Assessment; Europe,banking; biodiversity; ecosystem service; governance approach; risk assessment; Europe,,"Banerjee, Onil, Global socio-economic impacts of changes in natural capital and ecosystem services: State of play and new modeling approaches, Ecosystem Services, 46, (2020); Berg, Florian, Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings*, Review of Finance, 26, 6, pp. 1315-1344, (2022); Berger, Allen N., Banks and the real economy: An assessment of the research, Journal of Corporate Finance, 62, (2020); Principles for the Effective Management and Supervision of Climate Related Financial Risks, (2022); Aligning Financial and Monetary Policies with the Concept of Double Materiality Rationales Proposals and Challenges, (2022); Borrelli, Pasquale, An assessment of the global impact of 21st century land use change on soil erosion, Nature Communications, 8, 1, (2017); Nature Related Financial Risks in Brazil, (2021); Chen, Tinghsuan, Liquidity indicators, early warning signals in banks, and financial crises, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 62, (2022); Chiu, Iris Hse Yu, The EU Sustainable Finance Agenda: Developing Governance for Double Materiality in Sustainability Metrics, European Business Organization Law Review, 23, 1, pp. 87-123, (2022); Costanza, Robert, The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, Nature, 387, 6630, pp. 253-260, (1997)",,Elsevier B.V.,,09218009,,ECECE,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197362768,

The new CSRD legislation requires a wider range of companies to produce sustainability reports and their content is influenced by the EU's taxonomy regulation setting out the framework for sustainable finance. The disclosure of information affects the perception of companies' sustainability performance, which will affect their access to financial resources and development opportunities. The main question is, both in theory and in practice, how companies can comply with the legislation in the future. It is essential for the competitiveness of Hungary's food industry to keep pace with future environmental sustainability requirements, so we examined the sustainability reporting practices of the sector's key companies in terms of their contribution to the environmental objectives set out in the taxonomy regulation. The research fits well with the EU's overall green transition regulatory procedure and our study is gap-filling at macro-regional and sectoral levels. The sustainability reports were assessed by content analysis using a scoring method. The results show that the sustainability reporting practices of food processing companies in Hungary differ significantly. Furthermore, greater emphasis must be placed on reporting and the credibility of the reports to meet future expectations. Foreign-owned companies and companies with more than 500 employees attribute greater importance to reporting. In the food processing sector, the disclosure of information and data under the taxonomy objectives of mitigation of climate change, sustainable use of water and marine resources, and transition to a circular economy was most common. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg Criteria; Eu Taxonomy; Food Processing Industry; Sustainability Report,,,"Academy of Management Journal, (1979); Act Cxxxix of 2013 on Hcb Act Cxxxix of 2013 on the Hungarian Central Bank; European Journal of Sustainable Development, (2019); Arvidsson, Susanne, Corporate ESG reporting quantity, quality and performance: Where to now for environmental policy and practice?, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 3, pp. 1091-1110, (2022); Atan, Ruhaya, Environmental, social and governance (esg) disclosure and its effect on firm's performance: A comparative study, International Journal of Economics and Management, 10, Specialissue2, pp. 355-375, (2016); Baviera-Puig, Amparo, Assessing the communication quality of CSR reports.

The effects of this practice specific to the financial industry are examined in the context of green accounting, finance, and sustainability reporting standards and needs. Purpose: This chapter aims to analyse the impact of the circular economy on the finance industry based on three research questions: (1) What benefits and challenges does the circular economy bring to the financial industry? (2) What should be the financial industry’s strategic roadmap and business model for transitioning from a linear economy to a circular economy? (3) What are the differentiating aspects of ecosystem accounting and environmental accounting in its structure and use in the financial industry? Methodology: The method of our work is based on a ‘strategic road map for circular economy’ implementation and a ‘sustainability business model framework’ relevant to the finance industry. Thus, we systematically present the ‘value generation process’ considering the industry trends and dynamics and regulatory challenges regarding ‘green business model’ management with a strategic approach. Findings: To coordinate the transition to a circular economy based on systematic knowledge about the state of ecosystems and their interactions with society, it is necessary to design monitoring, accounting and reporting systems that adapt to the new business operating environment.

Directors and officers who either shrug off these challenges, or make missteps, are facing shareholder lawsuits and regulatory investigations. D&O insurers are stepping in, like they always have, to pay for claims. But inside the familiar paradigm, something different is afoot: D&O insurers are beginning to monitor their insureds’ climate governance. This Article argues that climate risk, unlike traditional corporate governance risk, threatens the financial viability of the insurance industry—increasing the incentives for D&O insurers to serve as climate governance monitors. By closely examining the intersection of D&O insurance and climate risk, this Article makes three contributions. First, it relies on qualitative interviews with insurance industry experts to provide a descriptive account of the climate risk facing the insurance industry, and how D&O insurers are starting to monitor their insureds’ climate governance in response. Second, it theorizes that this trend is likely to continue, not only for the obvious reason that D&O claims relating to climate risk are increasing, but also because both insurers and insureds benefit from improving their climate governance. Third, it makes a normative argument that invites scholars and policymakers to recognize, and fortify, D&O insurers as climate governance monitors. Global regulators and institutional investors are searching for ways to bolster boards’ climate governance. D&O insurers should have a greater role in monitoring the monitors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Blackrock, (2022); Reuters 18 April 2022, (2022); undefined, (2020); Williams, Cynthia A., Fiduciary Duties and Corporate Climate Responsibility, Vanderbilt Law Review, 74, 6, pp. 1875-1916, (2021); Cnbc; See Infra Section II C; Infra Section I B 2; Policyholder Pulse, (2019); See Infra Section I B; undefined",,Boston University Law Review,,00068047,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212529949,

We find that an investor may be able to reduce the carbon footprint of a typical index-based portfolio by more than 50%, while keeping active risk low, near 1% tracking error volatility. This involves investing in companies with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reducing exposure to companies with high emissions. The intensity of emissions per unit of revenue is a particularly helpful metric. Portfolio screening is an effective approach that removes emissions-intensive companies from an index, but can create unintended sector, industry, country, and factor exposures in the portfolio. Using an integrated portfolio optimization approach to minimize carbon intensity, we can explicitly constrain multiple risk dimensions. Another approach we explore is a two-step process: 1) apply a screen to invest only in lower carbon-intensity stocks, then 2) optimize the portfolio by minimizing tracking error versus the index. We study the effects of constraints on the optimization problem and find that loosening sector and industry constraints enables a greater reduction in carbon emissions, without a significant increase in overall active risk. Specifically, underweights to utilities, energy, and materials allow for a greater reduction in carbon emissions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Aswani, Jitendra, Are Carbon Emissions Associated with Stock Returns?, Review of Finance, 28, 1, pp. 75-106, (2024); Andersson, Mats, Hedging climate risk, Financial Analysts Journal, 72, 3, pp. 13-32, (2016); Bender, Jennifer C., Reinventing climate investing: building equity portfolios for climate risk mitigation and adaptation, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 9, 3, pp. 191-213, (2019); Bender, Jennifer C., Reducing the carbon intensity of low volatility portfolios, Journal of Portfolio Management, 46, 3, pp. 108-122, (2020); Bolton, Patrick, Net-Zero Carbon Portfolio Alignment, Financial Analysts Journal, 78, 2, pp. 19-33, (2022); Bouchey, Paul, Accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative: Using constraints to amplify factor-based indexes, Journal of Index Investing, 8, 4, pp. 93-111, (2018); Msci Research Insight, (2015); Financial Analysts Journal, (1986); Eccles, Robert G., The investor revolution, Harvard Business Review, 2019, May-June, pp. 106-116, (2019); Counterproductive Sustainable Investing the Impact Elasticity of Brown and Green Firms, (2023)",,Portfolio Management Research,,15347524,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201222310,

Our investigation focuses on the effects of ESG certification on both the quantity and quality of green innovation. Specifically, we analyze the mechanisms underlying these effects, testing the financing constraint effect and market monitoring effect on the quantity of green innovation, as well as the management opportunism effect on the quality of green innovation. Additionally, we explore whether the increase in green innovation driven by ESG certification enhances firm value.

Despite the extensive research on green premiums on the equity side, lending has received limited attention in the existing literature, even as regulations have increased and ambitious net-zero targets have been set in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors leverage a unique dataset comprising European commercial loan data spanning from 2018 to 2023, with a total loan value exceeding €30 billion. Hedonic regression analysis is used to isolate a potential green discount. Specifically, the authors rely on property assessments conducted by lenders to investigate whether green properties exhibit lower interest rate spreads and higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Findings: The findings reveal the existence of a green discount in European commercial real estate lending, with green buildings enjoying a 5.35% lower contracted loan spread and a 3.92% lower target spread compared to their non-green counterparts. However, this analysis does not indicate any distinct advantage in terms of LTV ratios for green buildings. Practical implications: This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interaction between green properties and commercial real estate lending, offering valuable insights for both lenders and investors. Originality/value: This study, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, represents the first of its kind in a European context and provides empirical evidence for the presence of a green discount. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Commercial Real Estate Lending; Green Discount; Sustainable Finance,,,"An, Xudong, Green Buildings in Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities: The Effects of LEED and Energy Star Certification on Default Risk and Loan Terms, Real Estate Economics, 48, 1, pp. 7-42, (2020); Bolton, Patrick, Do investors care about carbon risk?, Journal of Financial Economics, 142, 2, pp. 517-549, (2021); Bond, Shaun A., Certification Matters: Is Green Talk Cheap Talk?, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 52, 2, pp. 117-140, (2016); Econometrica, (1979); Green Asset Ratio Gar A New Kpi for Credit Institutions, (2023); Cadena, Anjelita, The Value of ""Green"" in Resale Residential Real Estate: Premium by Neighborhood Value Quintile, Homestead Status and Year, Journal of Sustainable Real Estate, 13, 1, pp. 12-29, (2021); Cajias, Marcelo, Tearing down the information barrier: the price impacts of energy efficiency ratings for buildings in the German rental market, Energy Research and Social Science, 47, pp. 177-191, (2019); Chava, Sudheer, Environmental externalities and cost of capital, Management Science, 60, 9, pp. 2223-2247, (2014); Chegut, Andrea M., Supply, Demand and the Value of Green Buildings, Urban Studies, 51, 1, pp. 22-43, (2014); Chegut, Andrea M., The price of innovation: An analysis of the marginal cost of green buildings, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 98, (2019)",,Emerald Publishing,,1463578X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183011574,

Previously identified financing needs within the fisheries and aquaculture sectors have been matched with the most suitable financing mechanisms. However, the use of blue levies is recommended and applicable in almost every scenario, as they allow these sectors to drive their own development in financing research and conservation projects to their own benefit. The use of “blue tokens” with sufficiently low repayment coupons allows development projects to gather public support for fisheries, thereby increasing the likelihood of the project being successful through community buy-in. The possibility of natural capital being traded as public equities as “Natural Asset Companies” provides the opportunity for development projects to fund themselves. The review concludes that natural capital can be leveraged as the base through which public-private partnerships (PPPs) can facilitate optimal delivery of ecosystem services, benefit multiple stakeholders, and provide numerous development opportunities. An enabling environment for debt and lending with low-interest loan repayments is also applicable to almost every scenario, as it facilitates access to capital finance for infrastructure development and the acquisition of increasingly sustainable fishing equipment. Steps towards generating an enabling environment for financing fisheries and aquaculture in the Caribbean region are also discussed. The establishment of dedicated financing institutions, PPPs, and sufficient data reporting infrastructure for the fisheries and aquaculture industry are essential for driving development in these sectors. Likely, the largest limiting factor in financing Caribbean fisheries and aquaculture industries is a lack of awareness of the range of finance and financing mechanisms available to stakeholders, as well as an enabling environment for financing blue Economy sectors. This review is thus intended to aid financing institutions, Blue Economy developers, and specifically Caribbean fisheries and aquaculture stakeholders and Caribbean governments by raising awareness of the financing mechanisms available, encourage the incorporation of their use in the fisheries and aquaculture industries in the Caribbean, and encourage policymakers to create an enabling environment for financing development in these crucial sectors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Caribbean Blue Economy; Fisheries And Aquaculture; Natural Assets; Sids Financing; Sustainable Finance; Aquaculture Industry; Conservation Status; Fishery Management; Limiting Factor; Natural Capital; Resource Development; St Vincent And The Grenadines,aquaculture industry; conservation status; fishery management; limiting factor; natural capital; resource development; St Vincent and the Grenadines,"The Ocean Governance Committee (OCG) is in place in most OECS Member States. They have, in most instances, identified and mandated the creation of National Coordination Agencies that work closely with the OECS Ocean Governance and Fisheries Unit (which leads and coordinates activities at the regional level). OECS Member States are at various stages of establishing national OGCs to serve as standing committees of public sector departments, statutory bodies and non-governmental organisations. Their goal is to facilitate inter-sectoral coordination on ocean governance issues. They may thus have an important role to play regarding the management of shared fisheries stocks and the conservation of the natural environments that underpin those important fisheries. Although the OCGs offer regional consistency and the ability to provide some support to nations seeking to implement Blue Economy approaches, the mechanism still requires enhancement. Barbados, despite being in the eastern Caribbean, is not a part of the OECS [], thus limiting regional consistency by hindering the establishment of a Barbadian OCG and the associated benefits therefrom. The Regional Ocean Governance Team (OGT) (funded by the World Bank) provides technical support to the national technical committees through the OECS committee on matters related to ocean governance and the Blue Economy.","Bethel, Brandon J., Blue economy and blue activities: Opportunities, challenges, and recommendations for the bahamas, Water (Switzerland), 13, 10, (2021); Fishstatjglobal Production by Production Source 19502019, (2022); Fishery Country Profile, (2019); March, Antaya, Caribbean Fishery and Aquaculture Financing Needs in the Blue Economy: Identifying Opportunities and Constraints in Barbados, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Journal of Sustainability Research, 5, 1, (2023); United Nationsblue Economy Oceans as the Next Great Economic Frontier, (2023); Failler, Pierre, Valuation of marine and coastal ecosystem services as a tool for conservation: The case of Martinique in the Caribbean, Ecosystem Services, 11, pp. 67-75, (2015); Status and Trends of Caribbean Coral Reefs 1970 2012, (2014); Toward A Blue Economy A Promise for Sustainable Growth in the Caribbean, (2016); Caribbean Climate Change Report Card Science Review, (2017); Official Flows by Country and Region from OECD Stat, (2024)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,24103888,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202643129,

Yet, despite its growing significance there remains widespread ambiguity about what sustainable finance refers to. Macro-political oriented studies from different disciplines have traced the evolution of sustainable finance and related it to broader financial and political dynamics like financialization or the rise of private environmental governance. By foregrounding these elements, they have, however, tended to paint a too monolithic picture of sustainable finance and related it to abstract discussions such as whether it is controlled by public or private actors. Micro-political accounts, inspired by Science and Technology Studies, have, by contrast, focused on the nuances and contingencies of amongst other metrics, accounting standards or green bond classification frameworks that make the connection of finance and sustainability possible. While these treatments have provided rich accounts of these technical devices, they de-emphasize the connections and evolutionary dynamics of their objects of study. This article aims to bridge macro- and micro-political treatments of sustainable finance by (re-)conceptualizing the evolution of the field in terms of an emerging and expanding infrastructure of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) information. Drawing from secondary literature, interviews, and participant observation data, it provides a three-staged history of sustainable finance from the perspective of the technical devices making up ESG information. It, thereby, offers a comprehensive view that goes beyond attributing sustainable finance to macro-level trends or isolated micro-level occurrences. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental, Social, And Governance; Infrastructure; Socially Responsible Investment; Sustainable Finance; Capital Flow; Environmental Protection; Financial System; Infrastructure; Investment; Political Economy; Social Impact; Sustainability",capital flow; environmental protection; financial system; infrastructure; investment; political economy; social impact; sustainability,"Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European Union\u2019s Horizon, 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No 722826.

This inclusion is vital, recognizing that financial stability and the adoption of innovative technologies are fundamental to meeting other sustainability targets. Design/methodology/approach: We base our findings on an extensive literature review, case studies, and interactive workshops with key stakeholders in the insurance industry. Our analytical framework employs Porter's (1985) insurance-specific value chain, complemented by Berliner's (1982) insurability criteria, to distinguish between insurable and non-insurable risks. Findings: Our results show that the insurance industry is sustainable because it actively incorporates and contributes to sustainability goals across environmental, social, economic, and technological dimensions. This is illustrated through the identification of 50 distinct contributions across the insurance value chain, showcasing the sector’s unique position to significantly influence the sustainability discourse. Practical implications: Addressing the pressing challenges of sustainability and insurability necessitates a strategic, collective response from the global insurance and risk management community. This paper proposes several policy recommendations, including enhancing risk assessment methodologies, diversifying insurance product offerings, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration, and prioritizing investments in resilience and preventive measures. Originality/value: By broadening the sustainability discussion to encompass economic and technological facets, this paper enriches the dialogue surrounding the insurance industry’s role in sustainability. It aims to inform decision-makers across the industry, political spheres, and broader society about the necessity of sustainability, fostering pertinent political discussions and highlighting avenues for future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Economic Development; Insurability; Insurance; Sustainability; Technology,,,"Aburto Barrera, Laura Iveth, A systematic literature review on sustainability issues along the value chain in insurance companies and pension funds, European Actuarial Journal, 13, 2, pp. 653-701, (2023); Awais, Minahil, Is fintech the new path to sustainable resource utilisation and economic development?, Resources Policy, 81, (2023); Insurance as Governance, (2004); Versicherungsmagazin, (2022); Limits of Insurability of Risks, (1982); Biener, Christian, Insurability of cyber risk: An empirical analysis, Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, 40, 1, pp. 131-158, (2015); Braun, Alexander, Are insurance balance sheets carbon-neutral?

Findings: The results confirm a positive association of CSR with capital adequacy, including higher quality Tier 1 Capital. The authors find strong evidence that banks with higher CSR scores are associated with greater bank value and lower risk. The extended analyses find that the improvement in capital is from annual growth in capital and lower risky assets.

The purpose of this study was to determine the reasons behind the gap in green finance between the two sectors using numerically derived outcomes. Six-year data in the form of total shareholder returns, comprising capital gains and dividends paid from the largest banks in China, the USA, and Europe involved in financing fossil fuels, were extracted from Yahoo.com finance and Macrotrends public forums. Equity premiums were calculated from the total shareholder returns and risk-free rates. A 95% confidence interval was established to determine the lower and upper limits of the equity premiums. The resulting upper limits were used to project premiums that could attract the private sector by 2030. Equity premiums averaged 2.73%, 9.73%, and 4.31% for China, the USA, and Europe, respectively, indicating the substantial task in the USA of attracting the private sector compared to Europe and China. The projections of total shareholder returns showed the same patterns in equity premiums among China, the United States (USA), and Europe. To bridge the gap, the significant need for economic benefits for the private sector should ideally be addressed through green bonds, tailored to green financing projects that are earmarked for revenue generation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Equity Premium; Green Finance; Private Sector; Public Sector; Total Shareholder Returns,,The APC was funded by University of South Africa (UNISA).,"Razak, Siti Sarah Abdul, Green Financing and Environmental Protection, Management and Accounting Review, 22, 2, pp. 63-82, (2023); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, A review of studies on green finance of banks, research gaps and future directions, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 12, 4, pp. 1241-1264, (2022); Alonso-Conde, Ana Belén, On the effect of green bonds on the profitability and credit quality of project financing, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 16, (2020); Ansah, Richard Hannis, Green economy: Private sectors’ response to climate change, Environmental Quality Management, 28, 3, pp. 63-69, (2019); Implications of Fiscal and Financial Policies for Unlocking Green Finance and Green Investment, (2018); Green Finance in Europe Strategy Regulation and Instruments, (2021); Clark, Robyn, Bridging funding gaps for climate and sustainable development: Pitfalls, progress and potential of private finance, Land Use Policy, 71, pp. 335-346, (2018); Czech, Maria, Effectiveness of Green Bonds in Selected CEE Countries: Analysis of Similarities, Risks, 11, 12, (2023); Desalegn, Goshu, Enhancing Green Finance for Inclusive Green Growth: A Systematic Approach, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 12, (2022); Demystifying Adaptation Finance for the Private Sector, (2016)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,22279091,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199855632,

A growing research body has raised concerns about the effect of such strain on financial stability. This literature on “financial transition risk” has highlighted that the conjunction of climate policy, technological change and shifts in consumption patterns may propagate to financial markets. In extreme cases, these dynamics may result in a “Climate-Minsky” moment with systemic implications. The field has developed quickly, covering many methods and research questions. While this expansion in literature is advantageous when studying a complex issue like the low-carbon transition, it also comes with downsides. The large number of methods hampers result comparison, and the integration of research designs. It also makes it difficult to provide a synthetic view of results in the literature as well as identify remaining uncertainties. To bridge these gaps, I propose a critical review of the literature. I examine three sub-fields: the asset stranding literature, the direct assessment of transition risks through prospective models and the financial empirics of the low-carbon transition.

We focus on debt sustainability assessments (DSAs) conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are linked to the IMF's surveillance and lending functions, and determine whether it is necessary to restructure the debt of a country in debt distress and the timing, process, and terms of such a debt restructuring. While the precise causes of each country's debt situation are unique, all countries are grappling with the rising costs and growing risks posed by climate change and other environmental and social factors. We suggest that the IMF's current treatment of these environmental and social factors is opaque, unpredictable, and hard for the citizens of affected countries and other outsiders to understand. It also obscures the true burden that debt obligations impose on a sovereign and the country's residents, and, thus, the amount of debt relief that it may need in order to achieve a sustainable debt position. To address these shortcomings, we identify financial, economic, environmental, and social (FEES) factors that we contend should be incorporated in the design of the frameworks governing DSAs and the operating principles and practices of the IMF through which DSAs are conducted. We argue that the IMF should draw on various hard and soft sources of international and transnational law to develop a FEES-based approach to sovereign debt sustainability that is more consistent, predictable, and legitimate than the current approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Global Debt is Returning to Its Rising Trend, (2023); Hakura, Dalia S., What is debt sustainability?

Scholars have put forward various reasons for investors’ enthusiasm for ESG stewardship. They include the financial materiality of ESG issues, a desire to appeal to ESG-conscious customers, and the scope for fund operators to charge higher fees for funds that pursue ESG strategies. There is, however, another critical factor at play. ESG stewardship is also underpinned by a transnational development—what this article calls the ‘global ESG stewardship ecosystem’. This global ecosystem is comprised of various ESG-focused actors, including United Nations agencies, institutional investors, investor networks, service providers to institutional investors, and NGOs and activist organizations. These actors operate in a highly networked manner at the transnational level to develop and disseminate norms of ESG stewardship throughout global markets, and encourage and coordinate investors’ ESG stewardship activities on the ground. This article highlights the scale, complexity and influence of the global ESG stewardship ecosystem, revealing it to be a significant facilitator of institutional investors’ ESG stewardship. This insight calls into question important contemporary assumptions and theories about institutional investors, including claims that they are ‘rationally reticent’, under-invest in corporate governance activities, and are incapable of overcoming collective action challenges. The global ESG stewardship ecosystem is also a remarkable example of the transnational influences shaping contemporary corporate governance. The ecosystem underpins the development and dissemination of norms of ESG stewardship and also assists institutional investors to undertake ESG stewardship ‘on the ground’ in the various markets in which they operate. The transnational influence of the ecosystem has important implications for national law makers and regulators who are focused on ESG investing and investor participation in public company corporate governance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Governance; Esg; Investor Stewardship; Transnational Law,,,"Aberdeen Standard Investments, (2020); Say on Climate Launches with Resolutions to Santos and Woodside, (2021); undefined, (2021); Woodside Adopts Say on Climate, (2021); undefined; Australian Asset Owner Stewardship Code, (2018); Media Release Acsi Statement on Rio Tinto Board Review of Destruction of 46 000 Year Old Caves in the Juukan Gorge, (2020); Acsi Undated Who Our Members are; New York Times, (2021); Guardian, (2020)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,17416205; 15667529,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191709175,

Insurance-linked securities have been developed in order to foster the risk-transfer from insurers to capital market. In the context of pandemics or health crisis, securitization has been used to raise funds for crucial healthcare infrastructure and resources. However, securitization can also play a role in lowering infectious rates of pandemics as a part of risk mitigation strategies. Securitization can be engineered at higher standards and levels involving different actors. In the current paper, we propose an operational securitization mechanism based on the previous work by Di Lorenzo and Sibillo (2020) where a bond with coupon linked to the infection rate is introduced in order to reduce the risk exposure of an insurer offering health coverage. The combination of bond and health policies is structured in such a way to foster the economic operators (insureds, insurer, investors on capital market) to reduce the pandemic risk. It follows that companies might guarantee collective health for their workers if they subscribe insurance policies. Indeed, issuing such a bond on the market is challenging, due to poor market liquidity and, then, due to difficulties in pricing. In these regards, we value the pandemic-linked bond via an approach based on an inter-temporal CRRA utility function that, in its turn, determines a certain equivalent financial bond. The comparison values the pandemic-linked bond at varying with investors’ risk-aversion and sustainable-projects desirability. This provides an estimation of the risk-transfer cost for the insurers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Common Health; Covid-19; Financial Engineering; Insurance Risk; Pandemic; Securitized Bond; Capital Market; Covid-19; Financial Market; Financial Services; Insurance System; Security,capital market; COVID-19; financial market; financial services; insurance system; security,,"Tirole, Jean, ECONOMICS FOR THE COMMON GOOD, pp. 1-564, (2017); Common Goods Reinventing European and International Governance, (2002); Saksena, Nivedita, Global justice and the COVID-19 vaccine: Limitations of the public goods framework, Global Public Health, 16, 8-9, pp. 1512-1521, (2021); Ericson, Richard V., Insurance as governance, pp. 1-414, (2003); Disease Control Priorities Improving Health and Reducing Poverty, (2017); Gavurová, Beata, Expert model of risk assessment for the selected components of smart city concept: From safe time to pandemics as COVID-19, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 82, (2022); Rezaei Soufi, Hojat, A quantitative approach for analysis of macroeconomic resilience due to socio-economic shocks, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 79, (2022); undefined, (2022); D'Amato, Valeria, Insurance Incentives to Pursue Social Well-Being, Springer Series on Demographic Methods and Population Analysis, 52, pp. 415-421, (2022); Verikios, George, The dynamic effects of infectious disease outbreaks: The case of pandemic influenza and human coronavirus, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 71, (2020)",,Elsevier Ltd,,00380121,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190443123,

Despite this, literature is still scarce. In this vein, our work contributes to the small but growing body of literature on sustainable finance insurances, by providing evidence of the positive role that insurance companies can play in realizing a more sustainable financial system. The study proposes an innovative securitized process, described as a financial cycle oriented to the achievement of the social objective of collective health. Sustainable instruments allow firms, insurance companies and investors to play a proactive role: virtuous companies, attentive to health protection of their employees, could benefit from premium discounts on the costs of insurance coverage for business risks. The analysis demonstrates how the securitization scheme supports projects with economic-social impact, underlining main actors’ roles, challenges, and opportunities for a sustainable future.

Importantly, the strategic leadership role of experienced CEOs constructs a good boardroom environment for the diversified board to place more emphasis on stakeholders’ interests and business legitimacy in a developing economy. However, we found a negative relationship between directors with a law background and CSD in the developing economy context, perhaps their role might be positive where a regulative environment exists for corporate sustainability disclosure.

Their supply chains, operations, and products fundamentally depend on and impact nature. These impacts and dependencies can give rise to nature-related risks (as well as related opportunities). However, despite growing expectations from stakeholders, most businesses are currently not adequately measuring and reporting on these. To date, it has not been clear whether this requires the development of entirely new indicators, or whether various existing sustainability reporting frameworks could provide sufficient information on nature-related risks. This paper evaluates the decision-usefulness of existing indicators for the softwood plantation forestry industry in Australia. Decision-usefulness is assessed against three criteria: (1) relevance and completeness; (2) faithful representation; and (3) comparability. The results show some potential for adaptation of indicators already used in sustainability-related corporate accounting and reporting, which could help reduce the reporting burden and encourage uptake. However, gaps remain in measuring the financial consequences for business from nature-related risks and in providing sufficient comparable information to evaluate performance across industries and locations. Implications are discussed in relation to recent recommendations from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) sustainability standards IFRS S1 and S2. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Reporting; Impacts And Dependencies; Indicators; Natural Capital; Nature-related Risks; Taskforce On Nature-related Financial Disclosures (tnfd),,"Funding text 1: All authors received funding from the National Institute for Forestry Product Innovation ( NIFPI ) (Launceston) under the grant NT011 , NIFPI is supported by the Australian and Tasmanian State Governments .

Our paper focuses on the bank financing channel and highlights regulatory areas for improvement. To mobilize the necessary funds worldwide, a degree of interoperability of regional taxonomies is required, which calls for international cross-pollination and coordination to mitigate financial risks and the risk of harmful market fragmentation (BCBS 2022, FSB 2022). Also, the full interoperability between the international and the EU corporate reporting standards is a desirable objective. A building bloc methodological approach would make such interoperability easier having the sustainability impact perspective of the “double materiality objective” as an additional layer of the international requirements well understood to all investors in EU undertakings. As per the inclusion of climate risks in prudential regulation, it is completed for Pillar 3 disclosures relating effectively with the EU Taxonomy. Climate risk’s long-term horizon still needs to be implemented in Pillar 2 by linking bank transition plans with stress testing based on climate risk scenario analysis covering both transition and physical risk. The inclusion of climate risks in Pillar 1 faces challenges similar to those of supervisors internationally. Fostering global ambition is an explicit objective of the EU. Its leadership on the realms of investor protection and prudential regulation of climate risks should ideally inform international cooperation and impregnate international standards.

We analyze universities’ Statement of Investment Policy and Procedures and Responsible Investing Policies to understand how responsible investing is included and how this varies by region. Our results show that most university investment policies are lacking in content and specificity. We compare four different regions, Canada, the United States (USA), the United Kingdom and Ireland (UK-I) and Australia New Zealand (ANZ) in terms of responsible investment integration. We find a clear international hierarchy, with the UK-I as the most advanced region in responsible investing integration, followed by Canada and ANZ with the USA a distant last place. We develop recommendations which act as tools to help mobilize university knowledge in responsible investing, drawing on globally recognized frameworks, in two areas: governance and policy. Our recommendations are broadly applicable to any post-secondary institution and also expand to other sectors attempting to incorporate responsible investing.

Recently, green finance practices are gaining popularity as a key strategy in many countries in the world. However, Nepal, which is renowned for its natural beauty, suffers from several environmental issues. For instance, international initiatives, of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN), emphasize the alignment of financial flows with sustainable development. The study has adopted a qualitative research method to investigate the practices and barriers preventing Nepalese commercial banks from implementing green finance practices. This study reveals the complex issues specific to Nepal through in-depth interviews with senior executives, risk managers, and sustainability officers. The findings of the study demonstrate several obstacles such as the implementation of regulatory framework, few green investment opportunities, perceived financial risks, a lack of knowledge and experience among banking professionals, and the requirement for strong institutional support and leadership commitment. To get rid of these barriers, it is recommended that Nepal’s commercial banks embrace green finance practices widely, fit into the nation's sustainable development objectives and support global environmental efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Commercial Banks; Environmental Issues; Green Finance; Sustainable Development Goals; Central Bank; Environmental Economics; Environmental Issue; Green Economy; Research Method; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Nepal,central bank; environmental economics; environmental issue; green economy; research method; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Nepal,,"Ng, Tuan Hock, Sustainability in Asia: The Roles of Financial Development in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Performance, Social Indicators Research, 150, 1, pp. 17-44, (2020); Anh, Vu Thi Kim, Factors influencing the cost-based pricing method: The empirical study of Vietnamese feed mills, Economic Annals-XXI, 171, 5-6, pp. 29-37, (2018); Policy Paper on Green Financing in Nepal, (2021); Guidelines on Environmental Social Risk Management Esrm for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh, (2017); Bouteraa, Mohamed, EXPLORING DETERMINANTS OF CUSTOMERS' INTENTION TO ADOPT GREEN BANKING: QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION, Journal of Sustainability Science and Management, 16, 3, pp. 187-203, (2021); Quest Journal Ofmanagement and Social Sciences, (2021); Tran, Thi Thanh Thanh, Factors affecting green banking practices: Exploratory factor analysis on Vietnamese banks, Journal of Economic Development, 24, 2, pp. 04-30, (2017); Lee, Jeong Hwan, ESG Performance of Multinational Companies and Stock Price Crash: Evidence from Korea, Journal of Economic Integration, 37, 3, pp. 523-539, (2022); International Journal of Business Management and Social Research, (2015); Adb Annual Report 2016, (2017)",,International Information and Engineering Technology Association,,17437601; 1743761X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194900388,

However, no reported study has evaluated differences in gender perceptions of the thermal environment in US Colonial Revival-style homes. As a result, this study aims to provide an understanding of variations in gender perceptions of summer comfort and adaptation in the buildings. The study evaluated data collected during the field studies of thermal comfort (FSTC), including physical measurements of environmental variables and subjects’ votes. In this study, 67% females and 33% males participated in the field surveys in summertime. The mean neutral temperature of 25.5 °C and preferred temperature of 24.9 °C were noted for females. For males, the mean neutral and preferred temperatures of 25.8 °C and 25.6 °C were observed. Females feel neutral and prefer “no change” to the thermal environment at lower temperatures than males. A difference of 0.3 °C was noted between the average heat indices for females and males. Male respondents who feel warm perceive less air quality more than females. Females and males who perceive being thermally comfortable also perceive good air quality. Females and males who are thermally comfortable rated air humidity to be acceptable. There are similarities and differences between gender perceptions of the thermal environment. The investigation suggests interventions that can help users regulate their skin temperatures and use control measures that are sensitive to clothing insulation. The research also calls for policies that can promote building users’ pivotal adaptive measures to improve their indoor thermal environment. The study enhances our understanding of sustainable indoor environments and how to improve living conditions and adaptive modifications among different groups of occupants in buildings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Colonial Revival-style Homes; Comfort Surveys; Comparative Evaluation; Gender Perceptions; Summer Comfort; Thermal Adaptation; Adaptive Management; Air Quality; Comparative Study; Gender; Perception; Summer; United States,adaptive management; air quality; comparative study; gender; perception; summer; United States,,"United States the Land of Diversity and Opportunity, (2023); Views of Diversity Many Europeans are Less Positive than Americans, (2016); Guide to Determining Climate Regions by County, (2015); U S Building Stock Characterization Study A National Typology for Decarbonizing U S Buildings, (2025); Adekunle, Timothy O., Indoor comfort, thermal indices, and energy assessment of multi-family colonial revival style buildings, Energies, 14, 22, (2021); Adekunle, Timothy O., Summertime overheating and heat stress in multi-family colonial revival style timber-frame buildings, 1, pp. 312-317, (2018); United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative 40 of Emissions Come from Real Estate Heres how the Sector can Decarbonize; Ardiyanto, Antonius, Thermal comfort of colonial office building, Semarang using EnergyPlus simulation, ARPN Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 14, 4, pp. 834-841, (2019); Iop Conf Ser Mater Sci Eng, (2021); Indraganti, Madhavi, A comparative study of gender differences in thermal comfort and environmental satisfaction in air-conditioned offices in Qatar, India, and Japan, Building and Environment, 206, (2021)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194406750,

This study used the panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) methodology to investigate the impact of adaptation financing on climate vulnerability. This analysis examined 52 African countries from 2012 to 2021 while considering their climate adaptation readiness. The impact was also assessed based on the Human Development Index (HDI) categories to reflect different levels of development. The findings showed that adaptation finance considerably influenced climate vulnerability reduction in Africa, particularly in nations with a moderate HDI. However, most countries still need higher levels of adaptation financing, resulting in a small impact on vulnerability reduction. Furthermore, the impact of readiness measures differed by HDI category. Economic and social climate readiness strongly impacted climate vulnerability in high-HDI nations, but governance preparedness was more critical in low-HDI countries. Based on the empirical facts, two policy proposals emerge. First, it is critical to reconsider the distribution of adaptation financing to reduce disparities and effectively alleviate climate vulnerability. Moreover, African economies should consider implementing innovative localized financing mechanisms to mobilize extra adaptation finance. Second, African governments should customize climate readiness interventions based on their HDI levels to improve the achievement of a positive impact on climate vulnerability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Africa; Climate Adaptation Finance; Climate Readiness; Climate Vulnerability; Panel-corrected Standard Error Analysis; Adaptation; Economic Activity; Error Analysis; Governance Approach; Human Development Index; Vulnerability; Africa,adaptation; economic activity; error analysis; governance approach; human development index; vulnerability; Africa,We acknowledge the support offered by the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences (MATE) and the Stipendium Hungaricum Scholarship.,"Tilleard, Simon E., Adaptation readiness and adaptive capacity of transboundary river basins, Climatic Change, 137, 3-4, pp. 575-591, (2016); Small Island Developing States Vulnerability and Resilience Under Climate Change, (2021); Glossary of Key Terms; Assessing Vulnerability for Climate Adaptation, (2005); Thangjam, Uttam, Climate change threat on socio-economic condition of agroforestry managers: A vulnerability study in eastern Himalayan state of Mizoram, Northeast India, Climate Risk Management, 40, (2023); Weiler, Florian, Vulnerability, good governance, or donor interests?

On the basis of analyzing the mechanism of climate change’s impact on urban–rural income gap, this article empirically analyzes the impact of climate change on urban–rural income gap using provincial-level panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020. Research indicates that climate change significantly impacts the urban–rural income gap at the 1% significance level, implying that climate change exacerbates the urban–rural income gap. This widening effect varies significantly across different regions, particularly in the western regions and areas with lower fiscal support for agriculture. Further analysis reveals that there is a mediating role between the total agricultural output value and resource mismatch in the impact of climate change on urban–rural income inequality; the digital rural construction plays a regulatory role in the impact of climate change on the urban–rural income gap. On this basis, policy recommendations are proposed to promote the development of climate-resilient agriculture, improve the meteorological forecast and early warning system, increase financial support, and optimize the allocation of agricultural resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Output Value; Climate Change; F323.22; F323.8; Resource Mismatch; Urban–rural Income Gap; Agriculture; Rural Areas; Agricultural Output; Agricultural Output Value; F323.22; F323.8; Output Values; Panel Data; Resource Mismatch; Urban And Rural Areas; Urban-rural; Urban–rural Income Gap; Climate Change; Agricultural Development; Agricultural Economics; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Early Warning System; Empirical Analysis; Financial Provision; Income Distribution; Panel Data; China; Agriculture; Human; Income; Rural Population; Urban Population; Climate Change; Humans; Income; Rural Population; Urban Population,Agriculture; Rural areas; Agricultural output; Agricultural output value; F323.22; F323.8; Output values; Panel data; Resource mismatch; Urban and rural areas; Urban-rural; Urban–rural income gap; Climate change; agricultural development; agricultural economics; climate change; climate effect; early warning system; empirical analysis; financial provision; income distribution; panel data; China; agriculture; human; income; rural population; urban population; Climate Change; Humans; Income; Rural Population; Urban Population,"This paper is supported by the 2022 Sichuan Provincial Social Science Planning Key Project \u201CResearch on the realization path and policy optimization of agricultural carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the Chengdu-Chongqing economic circle\u201D (SC22A017) and Research on the Collaborative Path of Promoting Carbon Reduction, Pollution Reduction, Greening Expansion, and Growth in Sichuan (SC22ZD005).","Asfaw, Solomon, Diversification Strategies and Adaptation Deficit: Evidence from Rural Communities in Niger, World Development, 101, pp. 219-234, (2018); Bauer, Johannes M., The Internet and income inequality: Socio-economic challenges in a hyperconnected society, Telecommunications Policy, 42, 4, pp. 333-343, (2018); Betancur, Laura C., Urban-rural achievement gap in low- and middle-income countries: The role of early childhood education, Early Childhood Research Quarterly, 66, pp. 11-23, (2024); Sources of Comparative Advantage in Polluting Industries, (2012); Cai, Xiqian, The impact of temperature on manufacturing worker productivity: Evidence from personnel data, Journal of Comparative Economics, 46, 4, pp. 889-905, (2018); Cevik, Serhan, For whom the bell tolls: Climate change and income inequality, Energy Policy, 174, (2023); J Agric for Econ Manag, (2022); Econ Res J, (2018); Social Sciences in China, (2013); Issues Agric Econ, (2020)",,Springer,,09441344; 16147499,,ESPLE,38722517.0,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192547452,

As the world is facing global climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has set the idealized carbon-neutral scenario around 2050. In the meantime, many carbon reduction scenarios, known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) have been proposed in the literature for different production sectors in a more comprehensive socio-economic context. We consider, on the one hand, a firm that aims to optimize its emission level under the double objectives of maximizing its production profit and respecting the emission mitigation scenarios. Solving the penalized optimization problem provides the optimal emission according to a given SSP benchmark. On the other hand, such transitions affect the firm’s credit risk. We model the default time by using the structural default approach. We are particularly concerned with how, by following different SSPs scenarios, the adopted strategies may influence the firm’s default probability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",91b38; 91g40; C61; Carbon Emission Reduction; Climate Risk; Credit Risk; G32; G38; Optimal Production Profit; Q54; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways; Structural Credit Model; Transition Risk,,"This action benefited from the support of the Chair Stress Test, Risk Management and Financial Steering, led by the French \u00C9cole Polytechnique and its foundation and sponsored by BNP Paribas.

In this article we argue that both climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy are clear and present dangers for financial stability. Accelerating the transition through proper risk management, both of micro and macro risks, should therefore be what regulators should do. Regulators should accept that they need to act with incomplete information. We agree with Demekas and Grippa that financial supervisors should not be the only, or even first, game in town. Nevertheless, we disagree that the effect of their action will be negligible. Financial supervisors should embrace the brave new world and play their role in addressing climate and environmental risks within the financial system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Changefinancial Stabilitycentral Banksfinancial Supervisors,,,"Demekas, Dimitri G., Walking a Tightrope: Financial Regulation, Climate Change, and the Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy, Journal of Financial Regulation, 8, 2, pp. 203-229, (2022); Sustainable Finance Lab Working Paper; Schoenmaker, Dirk, Can the Market Economy Deal with Sustainability?, De Economist, 171, 1, pp. 25-49, (2023); Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle, (2000); Chenet, Hugues, Finance, climate-change and radical uncertainty: Towards a precautionary approach to financial policy, Ecological Economics, 183, (2021); Green Swan Central Banking and Financial Stability in the Age of Climate Change, (2020); Proposal for A Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Directive 2013 36 Eu as Regards Supervisory Powers Sanctions Third Country Branches and Environmental Social and Governance Risks and Amending Directive 2014 59 Eu Com, (2021); A Call for Action Climate Change as A Source of Financial Risk, (2019); Supervisory Assessment of Institutions Climate Related and Environmental Risks Disclosures, (2022); Aggregated Results of Srep 2022 European Central Bankbanking Supervision, (2023)",,Oxford University Press,,20534841; 20534833,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190671046,

This is a key point to understand the potential exposure to mercury pollution of ecosystems and populations living in the river basins where ASGM is practiced, since the largest fraction of the pollutant is poured into soil, independently of the amalgamation technique employed. ASGM activities emit into the atmosphere mercury in its elemental form, which reacts very slowly with the major oxidants. Therefore, the exact location of the ASGM sites has a limited impact on the atmospheric mercury fate. Conversely, this cannot be applied to the mercury discharged on top of the soil. Two ASGM inventories and the related distributions available in the literature along with two novel distributions based on the intersection of zones characterized by low population density and rural areas were compared using a newly introduced Vulnerability Index. The results from this comparison showed that a precise distribution of ASGM is crucial to effectively evaluate the fate of mercury, and therefore the resulting effects on the local ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hydrological Basin; Mercury; Vulnerability; Artisanal Mining; Assessment Method; Discharge; Geographical Distribution; Human Activity; Mercury (element); Population Density; River Basin; Rural Area; Soil Pollution; Vulnerability,artisanal mining; assessment method; discharge; geographical distribution; human activity; mercury (element); population density; river basin; rural area; soil pollution; vulnerability,"FET Proactive project \u201DTowards new frontiers for distributed environmental monitoring based on an ecosystem of plant seed-like soft robots\u201D (I-Seed), funded by the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101017940.","Environmental Crime the Criminal Justice System S Role in Protecting the Environment, (2000); Mensah, Albert Kobina, Polluting our rivers in search of gold: how sustainable are reforms to stop informal miners from returning to mining sites in Ghana?, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 11, (2023); Meutia, Ami Aminah, Indonesian Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining—A Narrative Literature Review, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 7, (2022); Jurnal Rechts Vinding Media Pembinaan Hukum Nasional, (2016); Telmer, Kevin H., World emissions of mercury from artisanal and small scale gold mining, pp. 131-172, (2009); Green, Corey S., A comparison of factors affecting the small-scale distribution of mercury from artisanal small-scale gold mining in a Zimbabwean stream system, Science of the Total Environment, 647, pp. 400-410, (2019); Nkuba, Bossissi, How do technological changes in artisanal and small-scale gold mining affect the environment and communities’ health?, Extractive Industries and Society, 12, (2022); Sana, Adama, Knowledge and perceptions of health and environmental risks related to artisanal gold mining by the artisanal miners in Burkina Faso: A cross-sectional survey, Pan African Medical Journal, 27, (2017); Beal, Samuel A., Effects of historical and modern mining on mercury deposition in southeastern Peru, Environmental Science and Technology, 47, 22, pp. 12715-12720, (2013); Protected Planet Report 2018, (2018)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190251967,

The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) articulated a pathway to achieve the global vision of “living in harmony with nature” by 2050, with four goals and 23 targets to be met by 2030. Published reports indicate biodiversity finance needs are on the order of seven times current investments. This paper reviews recent public and private sector efforts to address this biodiversity finance gap and suggests priorities to increase progress toward its closure. In this review of biodiversity finance, we first provide a brief historical overview of the biodiversity finance gap, next describe current methodologies designed to identify, quantify, and bridge the gap in the public and private sectors, two sections reviewing current public and private sector efforts to close the gap follow, and a discussion of future directions and trends concludes. From asset management to biodiversity credits to crowdfunding, and from debt for nature swaps to environmental fiscal transfer and green bonds, we highlight efforts in the global south to address their biodiversity finance needs and meet their commitments to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Research on subsidies harmful to nature, more effectively connecting biodiversity outcomes to financial investments, identifying finance mechanisms that generate climate and biodiversity co-benefits, and further innovation in private sector solutions like biodiversity credits and offsets are future priorities and perhaps a research agenda in this sphere. We hope this review generates discussion and a research agenda within the biodiversity finance community to help us fulfil the ambitious goals of the GBF by 2030. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biodiversity Finance; Finance Solution; Global Biodiversity Framework; Investment Gap,,,"Financial Risk and System Stability Final Report of the Ngfs Inspire Study Group on Biodiversity and Financial Stability, (2022); undefined, (2020); Undp, (2022); undefined; undefined, (2018); Bhattacharya, Tania Ray, Financing biodiversity action plan using state appropriation account analysis: A case study of an Indian state, Ecosystem Services, 39, (2019); Busch, Jonah M., A global review of ecological fiscal transfers, Nature Sustainability, 4, 9, pp. 756-765, (2021); Practice, (2021); Practice, (2023); Integrating Nature the Case for Action on Nature Related Financial Risks, (2022)",,Elsevier B.V.,,22120416,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185513410,

These challenges are mainly dealt with, however, by considering individual threats in isolation (at least in political terms). The mitigation of dual climate and biodiversity threats, for example, is linked to a univariate 1.5°C global warming boundary and a global area conservation target of 30% by 2030. The situation has been somewhat improved by efforts to account for interactions through multidimensional target setting, adaptive and open management and market-based decision pathways. But the fundamental problem still remains—that complex systems such as those formed by the network of global threats have emergent properties that are more than the sum of their parts. We must learn how to deal with or live with these properties if we are to find effective ways to cope with the threats, individually and collectively. Here, we argue that recent progresses in complex systems research and related fields have enhanced our ability to analyse and model such entwined systems to the extent that it offers the promise of a new approach to sustainability. We discuss how this may be achieved, both in theory and in practice, and how human cultural factors play an important but neglected role that could prove vital to achieving success.

It examines the extent to which digital advances either facilitate or impede the sustainable development of companies, while also considering the systemic impact of demographic variables (such as gender, age, education), national income levels, and geographical regions on business sustainability. Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), which encompasses 26,790 entrepreneurs in 47 countries, this research uses multinomial regression to assess how these factors influence companies’ commitment to social and environmental goals. A key finding is that the strategic use of digital technologies in sales processes significantly increases the likelihood that entrepreneurs will integrate social and environmental considerations into their decision-making. Notably, this conscientious approach to business is most prevalent among entrepreneurs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our findings underscore the central role of digital technologies in driving sustainable business transformation while also highlighting the significant influence of regional socio-environmental contexts on business sustainability orientations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Country Income; Cramer’s V; Demographic Factors; Digitainability; Digital Transformation; Enterprises; Geographical Regions; Multinomial Regression; Sustainable Transformation,,"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the (1) SPIRIT Slovenia, Public Agency for Investment, Entrepreneurship and Internationalization, and (2) Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency (research core funding No. P5-0023).","Global Risks Report 2023, (2023); World Population Prospects 2022 Summary of Results, (2022); undefined; Report of the Secretary General on Sdg Progress 2019, (2019); Yamane, Tomomi, Is the younger generation a driving force toward achieving the sustainable development goals?

This paper aims to evaluate the social sustainability of banks by constructing a new interval-based composite indicator using the Thomson Reuters database. In this paper, to measure the social sustainability of European banks, we propose an approach to construct interval-based composite indicators that usefully extends the construction of the composite indicator and allows us to measure the uncertainty generated by the choices made in the construction of the composite indicator. The methodological approach is based on Monte Carlo simulation and allows us to improve the information provided by the composite indicators. Thus, we measure the value of the social indicator and its subcomponents and the uncertainty of the value due to the different possible weightings.

The performance of portfolios comprising high-ESG stocks was compared with that of low-ESG performance portfolios and with portfolios of companies that did not report such information, as well as against the main index of each market. A novel utility function was defined that allows evaluating different degrees of propensity to responsible investment, based on which restricted optimization processes were conducted to build efficient frontiers that combine traditional mean–variance aspects with ESG elements. Based on these frontiers, a measure of the psychic dividend or ESG utility premium generated by investing in high-ESG portfolios is proposed. Results obtained in risk and return rates and Jensen, Treynor, alpha, VaR, tracking error, information coefficient, efficient frontiers, and utility premium show the value of following responsible investment criteria and the clear disadvantages in investing in companies that do not report ESG information. This research contributes to the debate on the importance of socially responsible investment guided by ESG criteria, filling a gap in the literature regarding Latin America and confirming the better performance by calculating a wide range of portfolio evaluation indicators. We proposed a novel approach to optimization with sustainability constraints, incorporating the utility premium derived from investing in stocks with better ESG performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Developing Markets; Esg; Investment Decisions; Optimization Techniques; Portfolio Choice; Psychic Dividend,,"The authors are grateful to the Universidad del Rosario (Bogota, Colombia) for the academic support, and to the Junta de Castilla y León and the European Regional Development Fund (Grant CLU‐2019‐03) for the financial support to the Research Unit of Excellence “Economic Management for Sustainability” (GECOS) and to the Multidisciplinary Institute of Enterprise (MIE) from the University of Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain).","Ainsworth, Andrew B., Psychic dividends of socially responsible investment portfolios, Journal of Asset Management, 19, 3, pp. 179-190, (2018); Alayón González, José Luis, Generalized hyperbolic distribution: An application to portfolio selection and measures of market risk, Revista de Economia del Rosario, 18, 2, pp. 249-308, (2015); Alessandrini, Fabio, ESG investing: From sin stocks to smart beta, Journal of Portfolio Management, 46, 3, pp. 75-94, (2020); Ameer, Rashid, Corporate social responsibility performance communication and portfolio management, Managerial Finance, 43, 5, pp. 595-613, (2017); Ammann, Manuel, Tracking Error and Tactical Asset Allocation, Financial Analysts Journal, 57, 2, pp. 32-43, (2001); Amon, Julian, Passive esg portfolio management—the benchmark strategy for socially responsible investors, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 16, (2021); Anquetin, Théophile, Scopes of carbon emissions and their impact on green portfolios, Economic Modelling, 115, (2022); Anson, Mark J.P., The sustainability conundrum, Journal of Portfolio Management, 46, 4, pp. 124-138, (2020); Arribas, Iván, Negative screening and sustainable portfolio diversification, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 6, 4, pp. 1566-1586, (2019); Auer, Benjamin Rainer, Do Socially Responsible Investment Policies Add or Destroy European Stock Portfolio Value?, Journal of Business Ethics, 135, 2, pp. 381-397, (2016)",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,15353966; 15353958,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173428347,

The results highlight the need for enhanced usability across all criteria and offer key recommendations for policy development. Particularly, the substantial contribution criteria for climate change mitigation relating to the “manufacture of other low-carbon technologies” and “data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions” were found to be impaired by usability issues.

The susceptibility of these drivers to climatic adversities shapes their impact. Moreover, renewable energy generation projects are also vulnerable to climate risk factors, i.e., physical and transition risks. Existing climate resilience frameworks in the United States of America might be inconclusive to address this concern, and this inability is reflected in non-accomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 objectives. It indicates a policy void concerning the internalization of the climate risk factors for realizing the potential of renewable energy market. Therein lies the focus of the present study. The study analyzes the impacts of the returns on renewable energy drivers on the renewable energy market returns by controlling the climate risk factors from August 01, 2014, to July 06, 2023. The analysis is carried out by cross quantile correlation and multivariate quantile-on-quantile regression methods. The results show that the impact of the returns on renewable energy drivers on the renewable energy market returns reduces in presence of the climatic risk factors, i.e., natural disasters (physical risk) and climate policy uncertainty (transition risk). The climatic resilience-oriented policy framework developed in the study is aimed at internalizing the physical and transition climate risk factors, and thereby, progressing towards attaining SDG 7 objectives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Risk; Multivariate Quantile-on-quantile Regression; Renewable Energy Market; Sustainable Development Goal; United States Of America; Disasters; Energy Policy; Power Markets; Regression Analysis; Renewable Energy Resources; Climate Risk; Multivariate Quantile-on-quantile Regression; Quantile Regression; Re-turn-on; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Generation; Renewable Energy Markets; Risk Factors; Sustainable Development Goal; United States Of America; Sustainable Development; Alternative Energy; Climate Effect; Energy Market; Modeling; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Risk Factor; Sustainable Development Goal; United States,Disasters; Energy policy; Power markets; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Climate risk; Multivariate quantile-on-quantile regression; Quantile regression; Re-turn-on; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy markets; Risk factors; Sustainable development goal; United States of America; Sustainable development; alternative energy; climate effect; energy market; modeling; multivariate analysis; regression analysis; risk factor; Sustainable Development Goal; United States,,"Alharbi, Samar S., Green finance and renewable energy: A worldwide evidence, Energy Economics, 118, (2023); Sovereign Climate Debt Instruments an Overview of the Green and Catastrophe Bond Markets, (2022); Climate Risk and Adaptation in the Electric Power Sector, (2012); Auffhammer, Maximilian, Climate change is projected to have severe impacts on the frequency and intensity of peak electricity demand across the United States, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 114, 8, pp. 1886-1891, (2017); Bai, Dongbei, Climate policy uncertainty and corporate green innovation: Evidence from Chinese A-share listed industrial corporations, Energy Economics, 127, (2023); Baker, Erin D., Investment in risky R&D programs in the face of climate uncertainty, Energy Economics, 30, 2, pp. 465-486, (2008); Financing the Response to Climate Change the Pricing and Ownership of U S Green Bonds, (2018); Bartram, Söhnke M., Real effects of climate policy: Financial constraints and spillovers, Journal of Financial Economics, 143, 2, pp. 668-696, (2022); Bayulgen, Oksan, Vetoing the future: political constraints and renewable energy, Environmental Politics, 26, 1, pp. 49-70, (2017); undefined, (2023)",,Elsevier B.V.,,01409883,,EECOD,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181930937,

Despite public commitments, the sector’s initiatives remain inconsistent, and a wave of lawsuits imposes both financial and reputational risks. Through analysis of relevant legislation and case law, the article demonstrates hotels’ potential liability as venues enabling trafficking. However, inconsistent self-regulation and lawsuits reveal limited progress. The authors advocate for insurance companies to play a pivotal role in combatting human trafficking in the hotel industry by strategically adjusting coverage provisions. They trace the historical influence of insurers on the trajectory of slavery when 18th-century British insurers’ actions contributed to the rise of abolitionism and argue that similar private regulation today can incentivize hotels’ proactive measures against trafficking. The article proposes that insurers possess diverse tools, including exclusions, premium adjustments, auditing, and loss prevention, to compel action rather than complacency. Mandated self-insured retentions can also hold hotels financially accountable for their negligence. However, relying solely on pricing alterations faces challenges due to market competition and inconsistent judicial rulings on liability exclusions. Ultimately, addressing this complex issue requires a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach. Government fines and prosecutions can further incentivize self-disclosure and cooperation, while publicized settlements can promote transparency and empower consumers to make informed choices for hotel venues. This combined framework can transition hotels from passive enablers to active contributors in the fight against human trafficking, fulfilling their duty of care and catalyzing meaningful progress against human exploitation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hospitality; Hotels; Human Trafficking; Insurance; Modern Slavery; Policy Research; Public Policy,,,"undefined, (2020); Marriott International and the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery Survivor Training and Employability Initiative, (2019); Restatement of Torts Second, (1965); Bbc News, (2016); Bbc News, (2019); Human Trafficking Legal Center, (2022); Utah Law Review, (1996); A Risk Based Framework for Bribery Compliance Managementa Case Study in the Hospitality Industry, (2012); What is the Code, (1996); Fast Company, (2020)",,SAGE Publications Inc.,,19389655; 19389663,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176811882,

The theoretical grounding is exemplified by the empirical study based on individual interviews with managers. Study results explain how managers understand GC and how they see GC's role in enhancing companies' OS, as well as what are crucial barriers encountered in this process. The results show that GC, from a managerial perspective, are seen through the lens of people's pro-environmental awareness and knowledge followed by behaviors related to environmental protection.

This paper aims to establish a conceptual nexus between environmental performance mandates and the current needs of the users' social characteristics. Design/methodology/Approach: This paper adopts a SLR approach designed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for 21 articles that were selected as qualitative synthesis in this study. The search parameter for the selected articles in this review was limited to publications in three databases, Scopus, Web of Science and Emerald, between January 2016 and January 2023, with the help of qualitative software ATLAS.ti 9© in the presentation of the network codes. The initial literature search has retrieved 99 papers which sequentially excluded 42 papers due to exclusion criteria, and the researcher was left with 57 papers. Out of 57, 14 papers were then removed due to duplication of records found in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and 43 articles were further screened for qualitative synthesis. A thorough critical appraisal was applied to ensure that only selected papers were included, consensus was achieved among the authors and 22 papers were excluded. The qualitative synthesis has finalized 21 studies, and they are selected as confirmative findings. Findings: Using network codes presentation of ATLAS.ti 9©, the result shows that the social characteristics are influenced by the evaluated building category and the users' category – the stakeholders (owners, designers) and the occupants. New-fangled elements in environmental performance mandates are legitimacy and accessibility. The users’ social characteristics are derived from the category of users, where the stakeholders (designers, owners) are relatively a novel benchmark in meeting the POE objectives towards environmental performance. The least attention on the users’ social characteristics based on the findings shows that image, experiential (conjoint), happiness, interactive behaviour, morale and values are depicted as the social current needs in the environmental performance using POE. However, all stakeholders and the building occupants’ social characteristics must have a confirmative relation to the performance mandates, especially for newly performance mandates elements: legitimacy and accessibility. Research limitations/implications: The research limits the literature search between the recent January 2016 and January 2023 in Scopus, Web of Science and Emerald databases. Limiting the year of publication to the recent years is important to select and rank relevant scientific papers which encompass the reviewed subject. Other limitations include the selection of papers focusing on the POE approach and environmental performance as the main subject of evaluation. Other evaluation purposes that are not related to environmental objectives are excluded in this study. Originality/value: The characteristics of the social elements become a challenging subject in meeting the environmental performance needs as they lean more towards intangible elements. The novelty of the findings is drawn from the new pattern and current needs of users' social characteristics in POE for environmental performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Atlas.ti; Environmental Performance; Performance Mandates; Post Occupancy Evaluation (poe); Systematic Literature Review; Users’ Social Characteristics,,"The authors would like to express their appreciation to Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) for providing access to the subscribed online library databases, which were instrumental in accessing the literature for this study.","Abdel-Azim, Gasser Gamil, The importance of cultural dimensions in the design process of the vernacular societies, Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 9, 4, pp. 2755-2765, (2018); Adekunle, Timothy O., Thermal comfort, summertime temperatures and overheating in prefabricated timber housing, Building and Environment, 103, pp. 21-35, (2016); Clinton, Aigbavboa Ohis, Performance of a green building’s indoor environmental quality on building occupants in South Africa, Journal of Green Building, 14, 1, pp. 131-148, (2019); Al-Surf, Mohammed, Stakeholder’s perspective on green building rating systems in Saudi Arabia: The case of LEED, Mostadam, and the SDGS, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 15, (2021); Ali, Hikmat H., Developing a green building assessment tool for developing countries - Case of Jordan, Building and Environment, 44, 5, pp. 1053-1064, (2009); Ahmed Ali, Khozema, Issues, impacts, and mitigations of carbon dioxide emissions in the building sector, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 18, (2020); Altomonte, Sergio, Occupant satisfaction in LEED and non-LEED certified buildings, Building and Environment, 68, pp. 66-76, (2013); Altomonte, Sergio, Indoor environmental quality and occupant satisfaction in green-certified buildings, Building Research and Information, 47, 3, pp. 255-274, (2019); Andargie, Maedot S., Holistic building performance evaluation: An integrated post-occupancy evaluation and energy modeling (POEEM) Framework, pp. 463-472, (2020); Antoniadou, Panagiota, Development of an integrated, personalized comfort methodology for office buildings, Energies, 10, 8, (2017)",,Emerald Publishing,,02632772,,,,English,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85170716881,

In the last decade of the 20th century, new products have been developed for solutions to the problems that emerged with the climate and environmental issues. The financial sector has the leading role in the inter-sectoral cooperation necessary for the products to be inclusive. Financial institutions continue to be the main source for providing the necessary capital to combat the climate crisis and environmental problems. Accordingly, this situation continues to affect the banking sector, which has been sitting at the heart of the financial system, especially in European countries. Although this situation has opened up an area for the banking sector, the risks that may arise from the climate crisis also shape the sector. In this chapter, the positive and negative effects of activities called green banking on the sector will be examined. At the same time, proactive approaches that the banking ecosystem can take against the opportunities and risks that may arise in the future will be discussed. In this scope, Turkish banking sector is examined in terms of being green or not. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Risks; Green Banking; Turkish Banking Sector,,,"Climate Related Financial Risks Measurement Methodologies, (2021); Turkiye De Yesil Bankacilik, (2019); Coalition for Green Capital, (2022); Ding, Xiaowei, The Impact Mechanism of Green Credit Policy on the Sustainability Performance of Heavily Polluting Enterprises—Based on the Perspectives of Technological Innovation Level and Credit Resource Allocation, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 21, (2022); undefined, (2022); Canadian Journal of Business and Information Studies, (2020); Can the Green Credit Policy Stimulate Green Innovation in Heavily Polluting Enterprises Evidence from A Quasi Natural Experiment in China Energy Economics, (2021); Washington Lalon R M 2015 Green Banking Going Green International Journal of Economics Finance and Management Sciences, (2019); Three Green Financial Policies to Address Climate Risks Journal of Financial Stability, (2021); Green Loan Principles, (2018)",,Peter Lang AG,,,9783631905821; 9783631905814,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189235286,

The inherent similarities and intersections between cross-border provision of financial services and international trade law may result in potential collisions and opportunities for advancing legislation in the field. The potential collisions and opportunities primarily stem from the differing approaches of these regulatory concepts. Whereas the standards derived from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the EU’s free trade agreements aim at securing an overall balance of rights and obligations between states, Sustainable Finance intends to re-channel private capital into sustainable investments. Against this background, this book primarily intends to answer two interrelated questions: Are the EU’s Sustainable Finance provisions legal under, in other words consistent with, international trade law? Which role can international trade law play in the propagation and justification of Sustainable Finance policy?. Guided by these questions, this book offers the reader a three-step analytical approach towards the topic: First, this book provides a comprehensive overview of all relevant EU Sustainable Finance regulations and publications. The particular value of this overview results also from its focus on the respective legislative background and interrelation with international policy frameworks, such as UN development and climate protection agreements or bilateral working groups. This overview is followed by an analysis of the potential for collision between the EU’s Sustainable Finance legislation and its obligations under GATS and EU free trade agreements. Finally, this book identifies actual and possible channels of propagation and justification of Sustainable Finance policy through the WTO framework and the EU’s free trade agreements. This analysis is further supported by an overview on best practices and regulatory proposals on potential future consolidation of Sustainable Finance and international trade law. This book is thus highly relevant both for practitioners in cross-border financial services and international trade law as well as researchers and EU legislators wishing to understand the challenges and opportunities of implementing Sustainable Finance in light of international trade law. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg; Financial Services; Free Trade Agreements; Gats; International Trade Law; Sustainable Finance; Wto,,,"Zeitschrift Fur Unternehmensund Gesellschaftsrecht, (2019); Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon Climate Change and Financial Stability, (2015); Columbia Journal of Environmental Law, (2025); Limits to Growth, (1972); Eba Action Plan on Sustainable Finance, (2019); Summary of Eiopa S Roundtables on Sustainable Finance, (2018); Summary of Eiopa S Roundtables on Sustainable Finance, (2019); Technical Advice on the Integration of Sustainability Risks and Factors in Solvency II and the Insurance Distribution Directive, (2019); Equator Principles Ep4 A Financial Industry Benchmark for Determining Assessing and Managing Environmental and Social Risk in Projects, (2020); Commission Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, (2018)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,23648392; 23648406,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216088848,

In doing so, they establish 14 ocean-specific standards, including protecting the marine environment, providing transparency and following a science-led approach (UNEP FI 2023a). To date, 70 institutions in the investment, banking and insurance sectors have signed the principles, making them widely acknowledged. The principles also provide a detailed practical guide for financial institutions to avoid and mitigate environmental and social risks when providing capital to companies or projects within a sustainable Blue Economy (UNEP FI 2023b).; Funding text 2: Proceeds from the Blue Bond are directed towards fishery-only projects and focus on three objectives. First, an expansion of sustainable-use MPAs, second, an improved governance of priority fisheries though management plans and building institutional capacity to implement those plans and third, a sustainable development of Seychelles\u2019 Blue Economy, where investments are expected to develop greater value addition from the aquaculture, industrial, semi-industrial and artisanal fishing and processing sectors (SeyCCAT 2023b). To achieve these ends, grants ($3 million) are provided through the Blue Grants Fund managed by the aforementioned SeyCCAT, which has to date funded a total of 17 projects, while future blue loans ($12million) are provided by the Development Bank of Seychelles to facilitate a transition to sustainable artisanal fisheries, although the uptake of these loans has been rather slow thus far. Despite the total amount of the Seychelles Blue Bond being comparably low in market terms, it has nevertheless been perceived as a milestone in financing a sustainable ocean economy, setting off a Blue Finance trend. Indeed, Blue Bonds as well as debt swaps are increasingly applied instruments for funding the Blue Economy. In total, 26 Blue Bonds or swaps have been issued globally as of early 2023 (Bosmans and de Mariz 2023), and several more are currently being prepared.","Adb Oceans Financing Initiative Accelerating Blue Investments in Asia and the Pacific, (2023); African Development Bank 2023 Seychelles Economic Outlook, (2023); Assurance Report on Use of Proceeds from Blue Bonds Issuance of Bank of China Limited; Bennett, Nathan J., Towards a sustainable and equitable blue economy, Nature Sustainability, 2, 11, pp. 991-993, (2019); Benzaken, Dominique, Good governance for sustainable blue economy in small islands: Lessons learned from the Seychelles experience, Frontiers in Political Science, 4, (2022); Berger, Michael F., An updated orientation to marine conservation funding flows, Marine Policy, 107, (2019); Booth, Mara, Financing marine conservation from restructured debt: a case study of the Seychelles, Frontiers in Marine Science, 10, (2023); Bosmans, Pieter, The Blue Bond Market: A Catalyst for Ocean and Water Financing, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 16, 3, (2023); Eib 2022 Clean Oceans and the Blue Economy Overview 2022, (2022); undefined",,Springer,,23639466; 16135113,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207891300,

Mussell lays out the argument that a realist analysis of social responsibility reveals caring relations underpinning this ethical behavior. The combination of a realist social ontology with contemporary relational care ethics provides the theoretical framework needed to successfully explore the ethics of social responsibility. She then applies this realist caring relations argument to three specific contexts in which social responsibility is explicitly evident - including corporate social responsibility, socially responsible investment, and the legal concept of the fiduciary. By tracing the historical development of each concept - including how economic methodology has influenced interpretations and practice - a complex picture emerges, showing how ethics, economic theory, and political theory intersect.

In this context, climate finance, namely bilateral and multilateral financial flows from donor countries that aim to assist recipient countries in reducing their greenhouse gases (mitigation) as well as increasing their resilience to climate shifts (adaptation), has gained increasing importance. Nascent research adapts methods from the development aid literature - carefully shown elsewhere in this volume - to the realm of climate finance. This chapter provides a synopsis of this literature and its findings and highlights the limitations in understanding climate finance patterns. Further, many of the existing analyses investigate bilateral flows of environmental aid. Hence, the chapter also unpacks multilateral development banks’ (MDBs’) contributions in this area in suggesting avenues for future research. While MDBs are well positioned to provide climate financing, we show that their role in this area significantly lags behind their capacity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Aid; Climate Change; Climate Finance; Multilateral Development Banks; Unfccc,,,"Toward Mutual Accountability the 2015 Adaptation Finance Transparency Gap Report, (2015); 2011 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance, (2012); 2012 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance, (2013); Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance 2014, (2014); 2014 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance, (2015); Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance, (2023); 2017 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance, (2018); 2018 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance, (2019); Alesina, Alberto F., Who gives foreign aid to whom and why?, Journal of Economic Growth, 5, 1, pp. 33-63, (2000); Ayers, Jessica M., Climate change adaptation and development I: The state of the debate, Progress in Development Studies, 10, 2, pp. 161-168, (2010)",,Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.,,,9781800886803; 9781800886810,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207552989,

Providing appropriate strategies for climate change insurance plays a vital role in climate change adaptation and mitigation. It is essential to consider products and services when underwriting. The insurance strategy of direct insurers (reinsurers) should be under actuarial risk-based principles. Therefore, every decision and action taken by insurance institutions with climate change adaptation requires a risk assessment. The insurance strategy of an insurer can seek to promote insurance solutions for economic activities and, as a result, sustainability goals or characteristics for various reasons. Furthermore, insurers should refrain from making unaffordable insurance decisions. Therefore, examining international underwriting and dealing with the climate change insurance process in Iran can provide helpful strategies to managers. This research has been done to investigate the situation of Iran’s insurance industry in the underwriting of climate change. Materials & Methods: Initially, insurance plans, coverage, and climate change risk management strategies are reviewed in selected developed and developing countries. Then, the experiences of global surveys, including questioning based on the exposure of the American insurance industry, the climate change survey of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the global survey of the financial plan of the United Nations Environment Program, and the insurance survey of the Scandinavian region regarding climate change are used to develop a questionnaire in line with the current situation of Iran country in the field of climate change insurance. The respondents to the questionnaire were selected purposefully and non-probably, and the selection was based on their deep understanding of the subject under study and their participation in the climate change risk management process. Finally, 35 experts filled out the questionnaire. Findings: The results of the questionnaire’s analysis distributed among insurance experts on climate change risk management show that some insurance companies, despite predicting the impact of climate risks in their insurance processes and empowering their employees, do not have any plan for the assessment and mitigation of greenhouse gases, regular assessment of climate hazards, providing incentives and modeling. Also, the strategy of annual repricing and risk-based pricing is the highest priority for insurance companies facing climate change. Conclusion: Most of the country’s insurance companies use different strategies to deal with climate change, of which annual repricing and risk-based pricing have been the most popular. Use of natural disaster insurance funds, parametric and non-parametric analytical techniques in risk calculation and evaluation, development of insurance products related to climate change, natural disaster prevention and control systems, simulation and modeling of natural disasters, use of digital maps of natural disasters, land use, creating safe infrastructure, climate risk insurance facilities, and protection and restoration of ecosystems are placed in the following categories, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Risk Assessment; Insurance Companies; Pricing; Risk Management,,,"Issues Paper on Climate Change Risks to the Insurance Sector, (2018); Climate Change 2014 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability Part A Global and Sectoral Aspects Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2014); Climate Change 2022 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2022); Risks and Solutions of the Insurance Industry in the Face of Climate Change, (2019); European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, (2021); Climate Change and the Insurance Industry Taking Action as Risk Managers and Investors, (2018); Climate Adaptation Modelling, (2022); Analyzing Catastrophe Data in Spain, (2020); Dbrs Morningstar, (2021); Environmental Performance Reviews, (1999)",,Tarbiat Modares University,,23222700; 25382152,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206565178,

There are very few publications that offer a comprehensive approach to the financing of environmental protection activities by the European Union. This book explores this topic from various angles and levels, as well as highlighting the determinants that influence micro- and macro-level decisions in this area. It presents an in-depth and unique analysis of the sources of funding for environmental measures implemented by European Union institutions, against the backdrop of national expenditure by Member States, and analyses the plausibility of the adopted targets in the run-up to 2050, in the context of the war in Ukraine and ad hoc energy policy solutions. This book is a voice in an ongoing discussion among the community of practitioners and theoreticians on sources of financing for the energy transition to achieve independence from Russian sources in the quickest possible timeframe. It demonstrates that environmental measures cannot occur without the financial participation of economic actors and financial institutions, particularly the capital market, and further underscores the scale of involvement in environmental projects, as measured by the value of green loans and green bonds covered by European financial institutions. The authors offer policy recommendations for financing activities related to environmental policy, notably energy transition.

We briefly examine the basis of ESG ranking and rating confusion, concluding that the current methodologies of major providers result in neither significant change nor accurate disclosures by firms. Alternatively, we suggest that an integration of externality data will significantly modify Modern Portfolio Theory as it does not account for externality effects on “systems” (think market beta) or the interactive effects of firms’ actions on other firms in various types of portfolios, both directly and indirectly. These dynamics are qualitatively important given the growth and dominance of universal owner-type portfolios. Not accounting for externalities leads to sub-optimal economic system performance, reducing the financial return both absolutely and sometimes relatively. In turn, these dynamics redefine what financial “materiality” means. Finally, we place these concepts and developments into the context of global emerging regulatory standards and debates about them. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Mavericks Universal and Common Owners the Largest Shareholders of U S Public Firms, (2022); How Esg Investing has Impacted the Asset Pricing in the Equity Market, (2018); Economic Impact of Esg Ratings, (2022); Esg Confusion and Stock Returns Tackling the Problem of Noise, (2022); Quantifying the Returns of Esg Investing an Empirical Analysis with Six Esg Metrics, (2023); Cfa Institute Magazine, (2014); Global Sustainable Investment Alliance and Principles for Responsible Investment Definitions for Responsible Investment Approaches, (2023); Journal of Law and Economics, (1960); Complex Materiality of Esg Ratings Evidence from Actively Managed Esg Funds, (2023); Turning Down the Heat on the Esg Debate Separating Material Risk Disclosures from Salient Political Issues, (2022)",,World Scientific Publishing Co.

To achieve this objective, the study uses annual data from two leading countries in the issuance of sukuk namely, Malaysia and Indonesia, over the period 2017-2022. The findings indicate a positive and significant impact of Green Sukuk issuance on the SDGs index. These findings are consistent even when performing several robustness tests. The practical implications of these findings for the countries’ policymakers are due to the importance of IGF as an important tool for achieving the SDGs.

In this light, this article examines the effectiveness of the Regulation of ESG infomediaries through the lens of “functional regulatory consistency” with other infomediary regulations, for credit rating agencies and stock market benchmarks. It argues that this lens most aptly reveals the three key weaknesses of the regulatory regime for ESG infomediaries. These relate to sub-optimal coverage of scope, over-inclusiveness in the application of regulatory standards and under-inclusiveness where appropriate governance is not provided. the sub-optimal coverage of scope raises the question of whether ESG stock market index providers should indeed be regulated as ESG infomediaries or as stock market benchmarks more generally falling within the Benchmarks Regulation 2016.

Due to the strong expansion of environmentally, socially and/or governance responsible and sustainable business conduct and investments, there was a need for their more specific regulation. Of the aforementioned factors, the environmental (E) aspect of business received the most attention, which is also the most concretely measurable, while the social (S) and management (G) factors remained subordinate and less represented in this regard. This research is focused on the scope analysis, the measurement issues, and the impact of the social factor because human capital is an important factor in business, so respect for the interests and attitude towards employees, colleagues, customers, suppliers and the community is part of responsible and sustainable business. The empirical study on the application of sustainable and responsible business factors with a special focus on the social factor in the European Union in the financial industry and a more detailed analysis of the situation in Croatia is based on the latest available data for 2021 and 2022. The comparative analysis and proposals on the expression and measurement of the factors of sustainable and responsible business, the systematic presentation of the development and upgrading of the regulation of the field of responsible and sustainable business and investment, as well as the results of the analysis of the relative presentation and acceptance of ESG factors allowed conclusions to be drawn on the concretisation of the potential of the implementation and upgrading of a measurable social factor using the example of business insurance companies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg; Investments; Responsible; Social Criteria; Sustainable,,,"Berg, Florian, Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings*, Review of Finance, 26, 6, pp. 1315-1344, (2022); Brogi, Marina, Determinants of insurance companies' environmental, social, and governance awareness, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 5, pp. 1357-1369, (2022); Dow Jones Sustainability Index Ranks Caixabank Among the Worlds Most Sustainable Banks Caixabank Communication, (2021); From Sri to Esg the Changing World of Responsible Investing, (2013); Chatterji, Aaron K., Do ratings of firms converge?

With changing climate patterns, water conflicts are progressively intensifying at various levels, including sectoral, local, and transboundary levels. To ensure a sustainable future, adequate efforts therefore need to be made to minimize conflicts over water. In that context, an integrated and collaborative approach, incorporated within the broader development plans and actions, is imperative for realizing water management targets, as the conventional silo approach in water resource management has been ineffective in resolving the conflicts on water resources. To establish a deeper understanding of this issue, this chapter discusses the wide-ranging causes of water conflicts at different levels and explores the manifold solutions to mitigate them. To realize sustainable water management, this chapter emphasizes that an integrated and collective approach needs to be promoted across sectoral planning, spatial development planning at the urban-rural continuum, and transboundary water bodies management. Toward the end, this chapter also highlights key policy measures for enabling integrated and collaborative approaches in water management, including benefit sharing, assessment of environmental impact, and strengthening institutional coordination from the sectoral to the transboundary level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disasters; Transboundary Water Management; Urban-rural Partnership; Water Conflicts; Water Governance; Water-energy-food Nexus,,,"International Journal of Sustainable Development World Policy, (2015); Cities Alive Water for People, (2018); Barraqué, Bernard O., Urban water conflicts: UNESCO-IHP, pp. 1-309, (2011); Biggs, Eloise M., Sustainable development and the water-energy-food nexus: A perspective on livelihoods, Environmental Science and Policy, 54, pp. 389-397, (2015); Boretti, Alberto A., Reassessing the projections of the World Water Development Report, npj Clean Water, 2, 1, (2019); Conway, Declan, Climate and southern Africa's water-energy-food nexus, Nature Climate Change, 5, 9, pp. 837-846, (2015); Water and Urban Conflict Discussion on Issues and A Review of SIDA Projects, (2006); Douglass, Mike, A regional network strategy for reciprocal rural-urban linkages: An agenda for policy research with reference to Indonesia, Third World Planning Review, 20, 1, pp. 1-33, (1998); Flörke, Martina, Water competition between cities and agriculture driven by climate change and urban growth, Nature Sustainability, 1, 1, pp. 51-58, (2018); Impact of Disasters and Crises on Agriculture and Food Security 2021, (2021)",,Elsevier,,,9780443155383; 9780443155376,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205177752,

There is a growing interest in exploring green banking practices for fostering financial inclusion, economic growth and sustainable development as part of Vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia. There are insufficient studies that examine this in the context of Saudi Arabia. This study aims at exploring the potential of green banking in order to attain sustainable banking and financial inclusion in achieving vision 2030 in the country. Qualitative content analysis is used as a methodology of the study. Data were gathered through different sources such as: Web of Science (WOS), related journals, newspapers, pub-lished references, research papers, library sources and environmental organizations reports. It is indicated that green banking initiatives can be instrumental in fostering sustainable economic and environmental development in the Kingdom. The paper highlighted various activities of green banking such as: renewable and clean energy, financing green agriculture/food security, high-quality infrastructure among others. Nonetheless, some impediments to the green banking practices such as: risks facing green banks, poor quality of financial services among others are also mentioned in this paper. The paper proffers solutions to the challenges impeding green banking practices. In conclusion, the financial and banking industries in Saudi Arabia has been proving reform of the sector through greening economy. It is there suggested that the stake-holders and policymakers should provide efficient and effective technical, operational legal frameworks for enhancing green economy in achieving Vision 2030 in the country. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking Sector; Environmental Degradation; Financial Inclusion; Green Banking; Green Economy; Sustainable Develop-ment; Vision 2030,,The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Prince Sultan University for paying the Article Processing Charges (APC) of this publication.,"Baabdullah, Abdullah Mohammed A., An integrated model for m-banking adoption in Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 37, 2, pp. 452-478, (2019); Ahmed, Habib, Inclusive Islamic financial planning: a conceptual framework, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 9, 2, pp. 170-189, (2016); Laldin, Mohamad Akram, Developing Islamic finance in the framework of maqasid al-Shari’ah: Understanding the ends (maqasid) and the means (wasa’il), International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 6, 4, pp. 278-289, (2013); Issues of Implementing Inclusion for Students with Learning Difficulties in Mainstream Primary Schools in Saudi Arabia, (2017); Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled, Effects of financial inclusion on access to emergency funds for healthcare in the kingdom of saudi arabia, Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare, 13, pp. 1157-1167, (2020); Nolegein Journal of Financial Planning Management, (2020); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2020); Impact of Fintech Green Finance and Financial Inclusion on Energy Efficiency and Sustainability in Gcc Countries, (2022); Alshebami, Ali Saleh, Evaluating the relevance of green banking practices on Saudi Banks’ green image: The mediating effect of employees’ green behaviour, Journal of Banking Regulation, 22, 4, pp. 275-286, (2021); Ananda, S., Financial Inclusion in Emerging Markets: A Road Map for Sustainable Growth, pp. 1-332, (2021)",,"EnPress Publisher, LLC",,25727931; 25727923,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204957654,

Previous research provided discussions on the role of governance in supporting many variables as quantitative studies, but failed to demonstrate on going practices of how banking industries implement sustainable finance governance. Hence, this study provides originality by analyzing the extend of disclosures in order to evaluate their commitments in responding to sustainability regulations and guidelines, through disclosures of economic, environment, social, and governance (EESG) information in annual and sustainability reports. The samples were undertaken by examining the contents of sustainability and annual reports published for the financial year 2016 to 30 June 2021, for the Indonesian banks listed in business category 4, business category 3, and international banks, with the total of 202 reports. The results indicate that the implementation of sustainable finance in EESG information increases annually with social performances are the highest information disclosed, while the governance and economic information received the lowest level of disclosure. Results of this study will benefit policymakers, banks, and related companies to understand sustainable finance governance, and reveal the importance the role of banking industries to support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Ecosystem extent is a structure to understand environmental assets and uses a basic spatial unit to facilitate the classification and measurement of ecosystems by type. This study tested the impact of grid size and method of designation per grid cell for Marine Basic Spatial Units (MBSU), using Saleh Bay, Indonesia as a case study. The extent of mangrove, seagrass and coral reefs were previously delineated in 2021 for ocean accounting activities. This study 2 2 tested grids with two different cell sizes (10 x 10 m and 25 x 25 m) and two different methods of designation, namely: (i) dominance (extent-based) and (ii) hierarchy (criteriabased) methods. The results indicated that a larger grid size is related to higher error in estimating both total area per ecosystem and spatial configuration within the study area. The dominance method produced more accurate results than the hierarchy method, although, when considering computational trade-offs, a larger grid size and the hierarchy method observed a much lower computational cost. These results demonstrate the need to carefully consider grid size and method when designating basic spatial units for accounting activities, as they impact linked accounting tables and, in turn, have implications when providing information for management and policy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coastal Ecosystems; Ecosystem Extent; Grid Optimisation; Natural Capital; Spatial Analysis,,"This study was supported by the funding from the Global Ocean Accounts Partnership (GOAP), Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs United Kingdom (Defra UK) and the Ocean Stewardship Fund (OSF).","A Land Use and Land Cover Classification System for Use with Remote Sensor Data, (1976); International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering, (2011); Pedoman Penyusunan Neraca Spasial Habitat Pesisir Dan Perairan Laut Dangkal, (2023); Technical Note Developed as an Input to the Seea Experimental Ecosystem Accounting Technical Guidance, (2015); Congalton, Russell G., A quantitative method to test for consistency and correctness in photointerpretation., Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 49, 1, pp. 69-74, (1983); Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Data Principles and Practices, (1999); Ecological Economics Principles and Applications, (2004); Jurnal Penelitian Perikanan Indonesia, (2017); Fenichel, Eli P., Modifying national accounts for sustainable ocean development, Nature Sustainability, 3, 11, pp. 889-895, (2020); 28 Th Meeting of the London Group on Environmental Accounting, (2022)",,Pensoft Publishers,,23678194,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202520104,

The seminal such approach—enlightened shareholder value—posits that treating other stakeholders well can ultimately redound to long-term shareholder value. However, two more recent proposals reconceptualize shareholder interests in more holistic ways and urge that it is shareholders’ welfare, not shareholder value per se, that managers should pursue. In particular, the “shareholder social preferences” view incorporates into the corporate objective the degree to which the firm’s operations align with the social views of shareholders. The “portfolio value maximization view,” in contrast, argues that corporate fiduciaries should maximize the value of diversified shareholders’ portfolios by considering the externalities of the firm’s operations on those portfolios. Shifting to shareholder welfare as the corporate objective, however, would do little to improve corporate conduct and would entail substantial costs. The social preferences of shareholders are conflicted, muted, and often prefer less protection of stakeholder interests than provided by law. Shareholders’ portfolio value captures only a small portion of the externalities like pollution that its proponents hope to address and risks motivating anticompetitive conduct. And neither corporate managers nor shareholders would have the information and incentives needed to pursue these additional shareholder welfare considerations. On the contrary, by distracting management from their core competencies, shareholder welfarism would ultimately lower shareholder welfare. The future of CSR, as with its past, is instead with enlightened shareholder value (“ESV”). But the existing law-and-economics literature on ESV has been stunted by key misconceptions, which we attempt to dispel. The increasing use by various actors in the corporate system of normative arguments that sound in ESV terms may lead to new pathways for achieving social progress. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Del Code Ann Tit, (2023); Strine, Leo E., Corporate power is corporate purpose I: Evidence from my hometown, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 33, 2, pp. 176-187, (2017); Bebchuk, Lucian A., THE ILLUSORY PROMISE OF STAKEHOLDER GOVERNANCE, Cornell Law Review, 106, 1, pp. 91-178, (2021); Rock, Edward B., For Whom Is the Corporation Managed in 2020?

From there, we will also explore how insurers themselves and the concept of sustainable finance have an impact on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and how they may help to accomplish them. The proposed research methodology includes a section based on studies conducted by the sector’s employers’ association in Spain and another based on a series of interviews with experts and reference specialists. This is combined with an evaluation of best practices from leading entities, as well as a bibliographical review from institutional sources and monographs. Using these methods, we have demonstrated that insurance companies add value to sustainable finance from a triple perspective: as investors with high resource mobilisation potential; as expert risk managers, which now include environmental, social, and governance risks (ESG); and through the insurance business itself, through subscription policies and product and services creation/modification. Moving forward, we identified several areas of work which will be critical in defining the full potential of the insurance sector in the development of sustainable finance, such as EU regulatory development, integration of ESG risks into internal models, access to sustainable investment offer, and stakeholder valuation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Insurance Market; Sdg; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Finance; Sustainable Investment; Sustainable Products,,,"Sustainability in Insurance Companies, (2022); Sustainability and Asset Management Practical Guide II, (2020); Sustainability Report 2021, (2022); undefined; Sfdr, (2022); Spanish Institute of Financial Analysts, (2021); Sustainable Finance, (2022); undefined; undefined; March, (2018)",,Springer Nature,,21967075; 21967083,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200458606,

This completely transforms their customer rela-tionship from distant and sporadic to close and permanent in an attempt to create value, gain trust and increase customer satisfaction. This value creation could also enhance the industry’s already very significant potential to being key players in contemporary society’s global efforts to meet the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (‘SDG’). The actual or potential contribution of the insurance industry to furthering the SDG is also potentially relevant to the industry’s work towards gaining trust and increasing customer satisfaction. In this chapter, we look at the industry’s percep-tions of, and narratives on, their actual contribution to the SDG. Our main focus is on existing reports that reflect how the industry presents itself to the world in this context. We conclude that insurers seem to be falling short when it comes to narrating their own contribution to the SDG. This appears to be, at least in part, a consequence of the industry’s widespread lack of awareness and common misper-ceptions about the various economic, social and governance aspects of sustainabil-ity, as well as of the industry’s actual and potential role in contributing to the furthering of some SDG.

There is a positive correlation between the economic variables of population growth rate, gross savings, gross fixed capital formation, and the achievement of sustainable development targets (% of sustainable development in the GDPPC).

Driven by the expectations of investors and society, companies find themselves obligated to publish ESG reports. Therefore, this study focuses on exploring the impact of ESG information on the investment decisions made by individual investors in Vietnamese stock markets. By employing the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and conducting a comprehensive survey, coupled with logistic regression analysis on a sample of 232 individual investors, our research uncovers a significant influence of ESG information on the stock decision-making process of these investors. Notably, our findings reveal that investors place greater emphasis on governance (G) information compared to social (S) and environmental (E) information when making investment decisions. This trend aligns with the conclusions drawn by Sultana et al. (2018) and Mehwish et al. (2022) but diverges from the findings of Rounok et al. (2023). These findings are poised to catalyze the disclosure of ESG reports among listed companies. They also impel policymakers to craft and implement policies actively promoting ESG reporting. Such initiatives will likely foster increased interest and bolster investments in companies adhering to ESG criteria, particularly among individual investors in emerging stock markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",And Governance; Environmental; Esg; Individual Investor; Information; Investment Decision; Social; Vietnam,,Acknowledgements: The Hanoi University of Science and Technology supports the research under project number T2022-PC-080.,"Aich, Satyabrata, Factors affecting esg towards impact on investment: A structural approach, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 19, (2021); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); AlHares, Aws, ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE IMPACT ON CASH HOLDINGS IN OECD COUNTRIES, Journal of Governance and Regulation, 12, 2, pp. 104-119, (2023); Journal of Eastern Caribbean Studies, (2011); Corporate Ownership Control, (2023); Berry, Thomas C., Socially Responsible Investing: An Investor Perspective, Journal of Business Ethics, 112, 4, pp. 707-720, (2013); Chang, Rueydang, Effects of governance on investment decisions and perceptions of reporting credibility: Investment experience of Taiwanese individual investors, Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 28, 1, pp. 139-155, (2011); Crifo, Patricia, The price of environmental, social and governance practice disclosure: An experiment with professional private equity investors, Journal of Corporate Finance, 30, pp. 168-194, (2015); Deng, Xiang, Can ESG indices improve the enterprises' stock market performance?-An empirical study from China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 17, (2019); Dilla, William N., Investor views, investment screen use, and socially responsible investment behavior, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 7, 2, pp. 246-267, (2016)",,Virtus Interpress,,20774303; 2077429X,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196911238,

A qualitative methodology has been used, specifically content analysis, using the quality criteria for CSR-related information as identified by ISO 26000. The results show that there are differences between banks and none of them achieve compliance with all ISO 26000 variables; however, most banks demonstrate a moderate level of compliance. The criteria worst addressed by the banks are providing 'balanced' and 'accessible' information. Furthermore, the study reveals that the validity of the information provided, in terms of its relevance to stakeholders, is low. In terms of the banks' reputation, it is observed that the implementation of the PRB has not significantly contributed to building trust and reputation among their stakeholders, but it has helped their positive development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Financial Information; Principles Of Responsible Banking; Spanish Banks; Sustainability Reports; Transparency And Reputation,,,"Las Tecnicas De Analisis De Contenido Una Revision Actualizada, (2001); Aguado-Correa, Francisco, Evaluation of non-financial information and its contribution to advancing the sustainable development goals within the Spanish banking sector, European Research on Management and Business Economics, 29, 1, (2023); Baraibar-Diez, Elisa, The mediating effect of transparency in the relationship between corporate social responsibility and corporate reputation, Revista Brasileira de Gestao de Negocios, 20, 1, pp. 5-21, (2018); Responsabilidad Social Corporativa, (2019); Social Responsibilities of the Businessman, (1953); Implementing Principles for Responsible Banking in the Swedish Banking Sector, (2020); Revista Espacios, (2018); Jornadas De Economia Alternativa Y Solidaria, (2005); Equidad Y Desarrollo, (2012); Estanyol, Elisenda, Communicating corporate social responsibility (Csr): An analysis of the most award-winning campaigns of 2018, Profesional de la Informacion, 29, 3, pp. 1-13, (2020)",,Association of Professionals and Researchers of Transparency,,24442607,,,,Spanish,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195091611,

Firstly, the macro-financial environment may change due to new coercive regulations and the resulting inevitable rise in investment costs, indirectly affecting corporate solvency. Secondly, the transition costs paid directly by companies in the form of higher carbon prices may reduce their short-term earnings and hence their ability to repay their debts. These two effects modify the structure of corporate solvency, summarized in the transition matrices of corporate ratings. These matrices, calculated on a geo-sectoral scale, are used to assess potential additional credit risks due to climate scenarios, like sudden and brutal rising costs. In order to integrate climate-related effects into corporate credit risk assessment, we propose a method for assessing the effect of rising carbon price trajectories on forward-looking corporate rating transition matrices, taking into account the diffusion of risk across the geo-sectoral value chain defined with a Leontief input–output model. By way of illustration, we applied our method to US corporate rating transition matrices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",C67; Carbon Price; Climate Stress Test; Climate Transition Risk; E22; E47; G32; Input–output Models; Q54; Transition Matrices; Value Chain,,Authors of this paper are employees of EthiFinance.

In this paper, we outline mechanisms through which impact on sustainability outcomes is transmitted from financial systems to the real economy. We argue that, to have a positive impact on sustainability outcomes, financial institutions must make a clear contribution to: (1) reducing (increasing) the cost of capital for firms’ (un)sustainable activities; (2) increasing (reducing) their access to liquidity; and (3) encouraging or enabling sustainable corporate practices. We assess the potential for impact in each category across several asset classes. We analyse how financial institutions can integrate the development of “impact budgets” into strategic asset allocation. Finally, we consider ways in which future research could consider the implications for impact-oriented portfolio construction in more detail and develop empirical methods for further testing and quantifying the impact of the different transmission mechanisms we discuss. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Greenwashing; Impact Investing; Sustainable Finance; Transmission Mechanisms,,This research has been funded by the IKEA Foundation under a grant made to the University of Oxford.,"Greenium Matters Evidence on the Pricing of Climate Risk, (2019); Comparing Financial Systems, (2000); Anadu, Kenechukwu, The Shift from Active to Passive Investing: Risks to Financial Stability?, Financial Analysts Journal, 76, 4, pp. 23-39, (2020); Stranded Assets and the Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign What does Divestment Mean for the Valuation of Fossil Fuel Assets, (2013); Finance and Economics Discussion Series Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, (2015); Wiley, (2012); Bank Moves Out of Coal, (2020); Ssrn, (2017); Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment, (2019); undefined, (2021)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,16102878,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194169696,

Improvements in flowback and produced water treatment and recycling lead to reduced stress on existing water resources, particularly in arid regions. More transparency and regular reporting of water use/reuse benchmarks by operators are required to clarify the industry’s water-recycling performance. Substantial investments are expanding water-handling infrastructure in key shale-producing basins but the challenges to overcome vary substantially from basin to basin. Fracture stimulation of tight reservoirs uses and flows back substantial quantities of water and over a wellbore’s production life cycle also produces some formation water. That flowback/production water needs to be treated to remove a range of contaminants before it can be disposed of, recycled, or released into the environment. This chapter describes the fracture stimulation water life cycle, the quantities of water involved, and the impacts of its water consumption and recycling on available water resources. Environmental, social, and governance goals are obliging wellbore operators to extend water handling infrastructure and water recycling ratios to reduce water stress, particularly in arid areas. Water use/reuse benchmarks are described that make it possible to monitor water stewardship over time associated with tight-reservoir activities by individual operators and/or specific locations.

Chapters focus on three key circular economy principles and apply them to architectural construction and design, namely rethinking of the end-of-use phase of a building and the potential of design-for-disassembly; the role of digitization and data standardization in fostering evidence-based circular economy design decision-making; and presenting space as a resource to conserve, via exploration of the sharing economy and flexibility principles. Beyond waste management and material cycles, this book provides a holistic understanding of the opportunities across the building life cycle that can allow for sustainable and affordable circular housing. With case studies from 13 different countries, including but not limited to the Hammarby Sjöstad district in Sweden, the Circle House in Denmark, Benny Farm in Canada, VMD Prefabricated House in Mexico, and the Deep Performance Dwelling in China, authors pair theoretical frameworks with real-world examples.

The global forest sector is expected to play a major role in achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore practical and promising solutions to the challenges facing carbon accounting and policy assessment as the global community undertakes forest sector actions-including the widely known REDD+ initiative. This book demonstrates how vital it is that we identify appropriate perspectives and formulate approaches to address these challenges in an integrated and effective manner. In doing so, it addresses many of the major issues, including the differential potentials for carbon sequestration within various forest ecosystems as well as for storage within a variety of harvested wood products, the joint production of timber and carbon, and the measurement and impact of forest carbon offsets and credits, results-based payments, and other nationally determined contributions centered differences as well. The book examines regional and country-level case studies from across the world and draws on the author’s decades of experience working on forest policy and with the forest sector. Overall, this book highlights the technical and policy issues regarding forest sector carbon emission and removal to build useful perspectives, frameworks, and methods for addressing these issues successfully in the future. It advances the knowledge frontiers of global forest carbon policy, economics and finance as well as the ability to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of forest climate solutions.

The objective of this paper is to address this question by reviewing and synthesizing the economic principles associated with reducing GHG emissions, the pricing mechanisms used to achieve that goal, and the diverse practices of climate finance. Included in the carbon pricing mechanisms and practices are carbon tax, compliance and voluntary emission trading, internal pricing, and funding via issuing bonds or mobilizing public budgetary resources. Then, it proceeds to describe the roles that public and private organizations can play and have played in supporting emission reduction and removal, which serves as a vital backdrop for examining current states and relative costs of forest sector initiatives. Overall, as reported by the World Bank, only about 23% of global GHG emissions are subject to any explicit price, and 75% of the emissions that are subject to a price are charged less than $10 per tCO<inf>2</inf>e. Market-based forest finance and international support for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation have accounted for a small fraction of the total spent on climate mitigation and adaptation. Further, the more recent developments in carbon pricing and funding remain slow and disappointing.

Design/methodology/approach: The study used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data and test hypotheses based on a sample of 550 individual investors with investment experience. Findings: The results show that attitude, subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) have a significant relationship with investors' behavioral intention toward green investment. The moderating effect of (SMPU) supported the relationship between (SN), (PBC), and (BIGI), but (SMPU) does not support the relationship between attitude and (BIGI). Practical implications: This study provides some implications for investment providers, service providers, and policymakers. Originality/value: Despite the increasing global interest in climate change and its consequent opportunities and challenges for business, previous studies did not strongly emphasize green investment. So, based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study sheds light on the motivational factors that may push investors' behavioral intentions toward green investment.

The findings reveal that investors show stronger preferences for portfolios that contribute to the development goals; they are willing to forgo returns when investments contain SDGs or are provided by sustainable banks. These findings have implications for investors and fund managers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Investment Decisions; Investor Preferences; Sustainability; U.s.

The article transcends a focus within governmentality studies on domestic processes to reveal the relations between governance techniques and environmental subjects, including state and nonstate actors, beyond sovereign borders. Drawing on interviews, observations, and analysis of policies and reports, we identify three ways in which global environmentalities operate and are negotiated through the Green BRI. First, the Chinese state is embracing international sustainable development criteria to gain global legitimacy while seeking to export its domestic environmental governance model, making the Green BRI a dialectic policy. Second, the state is targeting and disciplining BRI participants, including Chinese financial institutions, construction companies, the renewable industry, and foreign state actors in BRI countries. Third, Chinese and BRI partner country participants’ variegated subjectivities arise out of the negotiation of their own interests, Chinese state interests, and BRI host country concerns. Our analysis contributes to understanding of how China, as a rising power, engages in global environmental governance and produces extraterritorial environmental subjects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Belt And Road Initiative; China; Environment; Global Governance; Governmentality; Environmental Policy; Environmental Protection; Local Government; Policy Implementation; Political System; State Role; China,environmental policy; environmental protection; local government; policy implementation; political system; state role; China,"Financial institutions are key actors within global environmental governance (Park ).

However, the same is not the case for retail banks.

However, the notion of Sharīah compliance has rarely been deconstructed; essentially, it constitutes a prohibition-driven enterprise. While avoidance of the forbidden (ḥarām) is fundamentally important, Islam encompasses a great deal more than the impermissible. Approaching relevant issues from the perspective of Sharīah compliance, where legal aspects are overemphasized, leads to legalism where the principles, norms and values based on the Qur'ān and Sunnah are largely ignored or compromised. Limiting itself to merely avoiding the ḥarām has significantly handicapped the industry from identifying and endeavouring to address synergistically the broader socio-economic challenges. In this article, a modified conceptualization based on a more nuanced framework of ‘Islam-compliance’ is proposed and explored, especially from the perspective of value-orientation in Islam.

The sample comprises 1215 annual, sustainability- and investment-related documents of 77 firms. We develop a dictionary with principles, criteria and terminologies as well as strategies, and differentiate between the quality of reports. Our results show that the number of firms referring to as well as the word count related to sustainable investing substantially increase over the sample period, and that insurers reporting about sustainable investing are on average significantly larger. We also find that European insurers report much more extensively on their sustainable investment practices as compared to US insurers in our sample. Most relevant in 2018 are references to general ESG criteria, followed by responsible investment and the Sustainable Development Goals. Top strategies mentioned were ESG integration and impact investing, whereby we observe that insurers evolve from mentioning one single towards multiple strategies over time.

Initiatives like the Bonn Challenge, UNCCD’s Land Degradation Neutrality Targets, and the UN’s ‘Decade of Ecosystem Restoration’ highlight the significance of ecological restoration in addressing biodiversity and climate change. Among many other factors, the mining industry is primarily accountable for land degradation caused by the constant need for energy. Restoration activities are therefore necessary to repair the harm. This chapter focuses on the intricate nexus between mining activities and environmental consequences. Besides, it analyzes issues such as mine tailings, spoils, and biodiversity loss to understand the effects of mining on the ecosystem. The annual environmental cost of mining is revealed through an economic lens, highlighting the necessity for thorough knowledge that considers climate change effects.

By integrating a series of case studies, this work illuminates the successful implementation of green finance initiatives across the region, showcasing the innovative strategies employed to address environmental challenges while fostering economic development. The analysis delves into the mechanisms through which green finance influences the evolution of financial markets in Africa, highlighting the pivotal shifts toward sustainable investment practices and integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into investment decision-making processes. The chapter begins with an overview of green finance, defining its scope and significance within Sub-Saharan Africa’s unique environmental and economic landscapes. It then presents a selection of case studies that exemplify the impact of green finance in the region, including renewable energy projects, sustainable agriculture, and green bonds. These examples demonstrate the practical benefits of green finance in terms of environmental conservation and promoting financial inclusivity and resilience. Following the case studies, the chapter analyzes the broader implications of green finance for developing financial markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. It discusses the challenges and opportunities investors, policymakers, and financial institutions face as they navigate the transition toward sustainability. The analysis further explores the role of international cooperation and policy frameworks in supporting the growth of green finance in the region. The chapter underscores the critical importance of green finance in enabling Sub-Saharan Africa to meet its sustainable development goals while enhancing its participation in the global financial system.

The research focuses on identifying the mechanisms underlying the issuance of SCBs in developing countries to unlock climate investment from capital markets and what they imply for facilitating just transitions. The research bridges scholarship across three fields: policy innovation, climate finance and just transitions, undertaking semi-structured interviews in two samples: SCB direct managers and intermediary and expert organisations. Drawing on Seychelles's blue bond and Indonesia's green sukuk as case studies, the research found that gaps in the public budgets of both countries were the main triggers for issuing SCBs and internationally, the influence of international organisations (World Bank and UNDP). Domestically, national wealth, access to international markets, alignment of the instruments' characteristics with political agendas and compatibility with regulations were key factors. SCB benefits, such as capital mobilisation, new investors and transparency, were perceived to outweigh additionality concerns or reputational risks (though higher transaction costs compared with non-green issuances remained a consideration). SCBs may be used as political statements in support of climate agendas, surpassing the perceived benefits of the mobilised capital. A legacy of exclusive dynamics in private markets remains a structural barrier for SCBs to be transformational in addressing climate change. Risk-return rationales and the exclusion of climate from countries’ risk profiling place developing countries in a more challenging position. While these instruments may not be sufficient to close the climate investment gap, they have an important role to play. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blue bonds; Climate finance; Developing countries; Just transitions; Policy innovation; Sovereign climate-aligned bonds,,,"Kajian Ekonomi Dan Keuangan, (2017); Azhgaliyeva, Dina, Green bonds for financing renewable energy and energy efficiency in South-East Asia: a review of policies, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 10, 2, pp. 113-140, (2020); Banga, Josué, The green bond market: a potential source of climate finance for developing countries, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 9, 1, pp. 17-32, (2019); Barbier, Edward B., The policy challenges for green economy and sustainable economic development, Natural Resources Forum, 35, 3, pp. 233-245, (2011); Bennett, Colin J., Review Article: What Is Policy Convergence and What Causes It?, British Journal of Political Science, 21, 2, pp. 215-233, (1991); What Counts Tools to Help Define and Understand Progress Towards the 100 Billion Climate Finance Commitment Internet, (2015); Bowen, Alex, Raising climate finance to support developing country action: Some economic considerations, Climate Policy, 11, 3, pp. 1020-1036, (2011); Bracking, Sarah L., Performativity in the Green Economy: how far does climate finance create a fictive economy?, Third World Quarterly, 36, 12, pp. 2337-2357, (2015); Climate Change and the Cost of Capital in Developing Countries, (2018); Financing the Blue Economy A Caribbean Development Opportunity, (2018)",,Elsevier B.V.,,29497280,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209568771,

This study evaluates the impact of projected climate warming on optimizing rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) for villas. An integrated modelling approach is employed, combining building energy simulation, PV system optimization, and performance assessment under varying climate scenarios. A typical Qatari villa is modelled in DesignBuilder and simulated under the baseline (2002) conditions and the projected years 2016, 2050, and 2100, reflecting incremental warming. Results show the villa’s annual electricity consumption will grow 22% by 2100, with summer peaks escalating to 26% driven by surging cooling demands. Techno-economic optimization in HOMER Pro (version 3.10) verifies a grid-connected rooftop PV system as optimal in all years, with capacity expanding from 7.4 kW to 8.2 kW between 2002 and 2100 to meet rising air conditioning loads. However, as temperatures increase, PV’s energy contribution declines slightly from 18% to 16% due to climate change degrading solar yields. Nonetheless, the modelled PV system maintains strong financial viability, achieving 5–8 years of paybacks across scenarios. This analysis provides empirical evidence of distributed PV’s effectiveness for Qatar’s households amidst escalating cooling consumption. However, maintaining solar mitigation potential requires evolving PV sizing methodologies and incentives to account for declining panel productivity at the country’s peak temperatures exceeding 50 °C. Overall, this study’s integrated framework evaluates residential solar PV systems’ capabilities and appropriate policy evolution under projected climate impacts for the first time in Qatar. The modelling approach and conclusions can inform building codes and pro-solar policies to accelerate adoption for emissions reduction. With villas representing over 100,000 units in Qatar, widespread rooftop PV integration can meaningfully contribute to national sustainability targets if implementation barriers are addressed considering climate change effects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Designbuilder; Gcc; Homer Pro; Solar Pv; Air Conditioning; Building; Climate Change; Design; Emission Control; Fuel Consumption; Performance Assessment; Photovoltaic System; Qatar,air conditioning; building; climate change; design; emission control; fuel consumption; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; Qatar,,"Evaluation of Embodied Energy and Co2eq for Building Construction Annex 57, (2016); Buildings A Source of Enormous Untapped Efficiency Potential, (2021); Bringing Embodied Carbon Upfront, (2019); Global Status Report, (2025); Why Buildings are the Foundation of an Energy Efficient Future, (2021); undefined; Global Status Report 2016 Towards Zero Emission Efficient and Resilient Buildings, (2016); Managing Transition Risk in Real Estate Aligning to the Paris Climate Accord Worgl Austria, (2022); Buildingsenergy System; Denholm, Paul L., Evaluating the limits of solar photovoltaics (PV) in traditional electric power systems, Energy Policy, 35, 5, pp. 2852-2861, (2007)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199229560,

Global climate policy has so far mostly focused on economy-wide emissions. However, emission reduction actions are ultimately sectoral, and opportunities and barriers to achieving emission reductions vary strongly among sectors. This article therefore seeks to analyse to what extent more targeted global governance may help to leverage mitigation enablers and overcome barriers to energy efficiency in buildings. To this end, the article first synthesises existing literature on mitigation enablers and barriers as well as existing literature on how global governance may help address these barriers (“governance potential”). On this basis, the article analyses to what extent this governance potential has already been activated by existing activities of international institutions. Finally, the article discusses how identified governance gaps could be closed. The analysis finds that despite the local characteristics of the sector, global governance has a number of levers at its disposal that could be used to promote emission reductions via energy efficiency. In practice, however, lacking attention to energy efficiency in buildings at national level is mirrored at the international level. Recently, though, a number of coalitions demanding stronger action have emerged. Such frontrunners could work through like-minded coalitions and at the same time try to improve conditions for cooperation in the climate regime and other existing institutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Buildings; Climate Change Mitigation; Energy Efficiency; Global Climate Governance; Buildings; Climate Change; Emission Control; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; International Cooperation; Barriers To Energy Efficiencies; Climate Change Mitigation; Climate Policy; Economy-wide Emissions; Emission Reduction; Energy Efficiency In Buildings; Energy Efficient Building; Global Climate Governance; Global Climates; Global Governance; Energy Efficiency; Climate Change; Emission Control; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Policy; Global Climate; Greenhouse Gas; International Cooperation,Buildings; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Barriers to energy efficiencies; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Economy-wide emissions; Emission reduction; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy efficient building; Global climate governance; Global climates; Global governance; Energy efficiency; climate change; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental policy; global climate; greenhouse gas; international cooperation,"Funding text 1: This contribution is a result of the NDC ASPECTS project which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101003866.

Although private companies—especially those in the energy sector—have a significant role in the climate crisis, current strategies focus mainly on public companies. Such a single-minded approach to policymaking could give rise to a phenomenon that we term sustainability arbitrage, whereby activities causing climate change gradually shift from public firms to private ones. This may, in turn, create a world where public firms look relatively green while their private rivals become the main driver of activities contributing to the climate crisis. In this paper, we focus on sustainability arbitrage, its manifestations and possible strategies to overcome this problem. We first discuss if the current sustainability-driven corporate governance mechanisms are effective in curbing the sustainability arbitrage problem. In order to prevent sustainability arbitrage, we argue for extending mandatory climate disclosure rules to private companies. We also analyze responsible divestment/phasing out of carbon-intensive assets by public companies as a complementary strategy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Company Law; Disclosure; Private Companies; Sustainability; Sustainability Arbitrage,,,"Unily, (2020); Bloomberg 15 April 2021, (2021); Bloomberg 9 June 2021, (2021); Do Private Firms Perform Better than Public Firms, (2025); Private Equitys Upstream Journey, (2020); Anatomy of Corporate Law A Comparative and Functional Approach, (2009); Business Law and the Net Zero Economy Oxford Business Law Blog, (2021); Columbia Business Law Review, (2021); Oxford Bus L Blog, (2022); Principles of Financial Regulation, (2016)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,17416205; 15667529,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174402818,

But the research community are yet to provide a framework for private investors and borrowers to assess the commercial viability of investments in adaptation. To date, investment cases have not been constructed with climate adaptation as the underlying investment logic - no framework explains how adaptation creates value and converts to cash flows. Instead cases are made as standard equity, debt or loan investments in climate vulnerable contexts, or as poorly specified climate resilience or adaptation solutions. Such specialisms and experiences are present within the public sector adaptation evaluation community, but they typically have few means to communicate with private investors and private adapting entities. This perspective sets out how private investments in adaptation generates value and cash flows that can be applied in investment cases to guide investors and those seeking to raise capital. First it sets out the conceptual and practical linkages between effective adaptation, value and cash flows. It then shows the importance of cash flows when formulating basic financial asset pricing methods, using examples of intangible assets for equity and fair value for debt-based instruments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Asset Pricing; Private Investment; Adaptation; Debt; Ecosystem Resilience; Investment; Private Sector; Public Sector,adaptation; debt; ecosystem resilience; investment; private sector; public sector,The authors would like to thank Simon Anderson for his thought leadership and guidance that is the foundation of this concept.

In their role as major global institutional investors and risk managers, insurance companies and pension funds are strategic players in building socio-economic and sustainable development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of action and research on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the insurance and pension sectors, we conduct a systematic literature review. We rely on the PRISMA protocol and analyze 1 731 academic publications available in the Web of Science database up to the year 2022 and refer to 23 studies outside of scientific research retrieved from the websites of key international and European organizations. To study the corpus of literature, we introduce a classification framework along the insurance value chain including external stakeholders. The main findings reveal that risk, underwriting and investment management are the most researched areas among the nine categories considered in our framework, while claims management and sales tend to be neglected. Regarding ESG factors, climate change, as part of the environmental factor, has received the most attention in the literature. After reviewing the literature, we summarize the main sustainability issues and potential related actions.

Stress testing has emerged as one of the most prevalent regulatory tools for addressing climate-related financial risks, and this article analyzes the role of stress testing in mitigating the effects of climate change on financial stability. Specifically, it synthesizes the multi-disciplinary literature on climate-related financial risk, financial stability, and stress testing to develop a framework for evaluating the capacity and effectiveness of stress tests for measuring and managing climate-related systemic financial risk. It then takes stock of climate stress testing proposals and early practices globally and applies the evaluative framework in comparative case studies of the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve. It concludes that stress testing can support the measurement and management of both microprudential and macroprudential climate-related financial risks, but the benefits of stress testing vis-à-vis climate change and financial stability are largely unrealized. Addressing the disconnect between climate stress testing policy motivation and implementation as well as the divergence between leading and lagging jurisdictions will require both interagency and international regulatory cooperation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate-related Financial Risk; Financial Stability; Macroprudential Regulation; Stress Testing; Systemic Risk,,,"Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon Climate Change and Financial Stability, (2015); Tackling Climate Change the Role of Banking Regulation and Supervision, (2020); Climate Change 2013 the Physical Science Basis, (2025); Campiglio, Emanuele, Climate change challenges for central banks and financial regulators, Nature Climate Change, 8, 6, pp. 462-468, (2018); Stocktake of Financial Authorities Experience in Including Physical and Transition Climate Risks as Part of their Financial Stability Monitoring, (2020); Climate Related Financial Risks A Survey on Current Initiatives, (2020); Climate Change Financial Risk Act of 2019; Accelerating Decarbonization of the U.S. Energy System, pp. 1-254, (2021); Report on Climate Related Financial Risk, (2021); Managing Climate Risk in the U S Financial System, (2025)",,Palgrave Macmillan,,17456452; 17502071,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142876011,

The call for sustainability transformations in financial services arose out of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goal agenda. The financial services sector plays an important role in providing sustainable financial services to nudge sustainability practices among firms and consumers around the world. However, efforts for sustainability transformations among financial service providers are still slow, and little research has been documented in this area. So far, no bibliometric analysis has been conducted in this area as well. Therefore, this research undertakes a comprehensive snooping review of extant sustainable financial services research in order to establish a trend of existing financial services sustainability activities to enhance future research possibilities. Our comprehensive review of the Scopus database was guided by the PRISMA protocols, including PRISMA-P and SPAR-4-SLR. Bibliometric and content analysis approaches were also employed as analytical tools within an analytical framework. This study has also employed Microsoft Excel and the VOSviewer tool in conducting performance and science mapping analyses. After article filtering for “sustainability” was conducted, a total of 103 research documents published between 1991 and 2022 were identified as usable samples, which were critically reviewed and analyzed in this study by means of content analysis. Three major themes were investigated, including—sustainable financial products, sustainable financial services delivery, and sustainable financial services marketing strategies. Our findings show a recent growth in academic publications in the area, but also indicate relatively low financial sustainability activities around the world. This research therefore aims to provide present and future innovative insights on sustainable financial services aimed at stimulating more financial institutions, financial service managers, policy makers, and academic researchers to take more action toward greater sustainability development activities in the financial services sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking Institutions; Bibliometrics; Financial Services; Non-bank Financial Institutions; Sdg; Sustainability; Sustainable Financial Services Marketing,,,"Adler, Matthias, microfinance 3.0"" - Perspectives for sustainable financial service delivery, pp. 123-137, (2013); Adom, Philip Kofi, Does financial development lower energy intensity?, Frontiers in Energy, 14, 3, pp. 620-634, (2020); International Monetary Fund Special Series on Covid 19 Transactions, (2020); Aitken, Robert, Envisioning a sustainable consumption future, Young Consumers, 20, 4, pp. 299-313, (2019); Ajina, Ahmed Suhail, Enhancing brand value using corporate social responsibility initiatives: Evidence from financial services brands in Saudi Arabia, Qualitative Market Research, 23, 4, pp. 575-602, (2020); Alharthi, Majed D., A comparative study of efficiency and its determinants in islamic, conventional, and socially responsible banks, Corporate Ownership and Control, 13, 4Cont3, pp. 470-482, (2016); Different Shades of Green Environment Uncertainty and the Strategies of Hybrid Organisations, (2017); Amuakwa-Mensah, Franklin, Unveiling the energy saving role of banking performance in Sub-Sahara Africa, Energy Economics, 74, pp. 828-842, (2018); Aracil, Elisa, Sustainable banking: A literature review and integrative framework, Finance Research Letters, 42, (2021); Journal of Financial Planning, (2021)",,Palgrave Macmillan,,14791846; 13630539,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141438014,

Following a systematic literature review, an online survey was designed and conducted. Multivariate regression models were used for the analysis. The findings illustrate that individuals with a greater level of sustainable finance literacy and a positive perception of the favorable environmental effects of sustainable finance instruments tend to exhibit a positive investment stance and are more likely to invest in sustainable finance instruments. Among the questions related to sustainable finance literacy, the most significant factor in explaining sustainable investment attitude is the knowledge of how sustainable finance instruments can be utilized for risk diversification. In addition, it is depicted that individuals with higher income levels exhibit a favorable disposition toward sustainable finance instruments.

The development of this model is particularly relevant for regions with established carbon trading markets, with a specific focus on the post-period following the 2015 Paris Agreement concerning climate change. We focus on shareholders and policyholders to optimize equity and ensure maximum protection. Strict caps in cap- and-trade harm interest margins, reducing guaranteed rates for equity maximization and compromising policyholder protection. Government intervention through sustainable production carbon trading hinders win-win outcomes. Green subsidies can improve insurer margins, but achieving win-win solutions remains challenging.

We set out an agenda to move development finance towards net zero goals in a way that acknowledges development concerns. These include (1) setting context-specific emissions pathways with granular bottom-up data and emphasising climate-development win-wins; (2) dealing with inertia and lumpiness in the portfolio through ‘when’ flexibility (multiyear carbon budgets) and ‘where’ flexibility (sharing of carbon space); (3) encouraging transition projects through future-emissions accounting and transition credits; (4) managing climate-development and other trade-offs with an internal carbon price and ESG standards; and (5) accounting for emissions after project-end with monitoring and legal provisions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,"The production of this paper was funded by British International Investment (BII).

The starting point is a factorial panel data model which is subsequently modified to capture the climate impact through different functional forms. We find that relevant differences in default risk exist before and after the Paris Agreement. Our analysis also indicates that this difference cannot be explained by means of traditional financial factors. Finally, we further show that a climate change risk and opportunities label is a significant factor in evaluating credit risk, both prior to and post-Paris agreement. These results are important to the extent that they suggest that companies' market performance itself allows to measure differences in credit risk between companies and to link them with climate risk factors. This approach may be useful as a complement or in combination with the traditional use of exogenous climate factors that have been widely used in the literature in this field. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Risk; Credit Risk; Distance To Default; Transition Risk; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Finance; Risk Factor; Europe,climate change; climate effect; finance; risk factor; Europe,The work was supported by Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00F3n a Distancia (UNED) [076-044355 ENER-UK] and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PID2020-113367RBI00].

Design/methodology/approach: Using univariate statistical and multiple regression analyses, this study quantitatively examines the impacts of coercive pressure from the government and stock exchanges, imitation within subsectors and normative pressure from industry associations and regulators on the quality of China’s listed FIs’ sustainability disclosures. Assessment of the robustness of regression results uses panel random-effects and generalized methods of moments estimation. Findings: Financial sector corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure quality did not increase dramatically following issue of the “Guiding Opinions on Establishing a Green Finance System.” However, a convergence in quality is found over time. State ownership concentration and state links to dominant shareholders negatively impact the quality of financial sector sustainability disclosures, whereas stock exchange index listing requirements and industry association reporting guidance have positive influences. Research limitations/implications: First, data availability limits the sample to listed financial firms with RKS quality scores. Thus, results may not be generalizable to the broader listed and unlisted financial sector. Second, this study only examines the influence of external forces based on institutional theory. However, internal institutional forces, such as corporate governance, may require examination. This study’s results indicate that coercive pressure, as represented by issue of the “Green Finance” policy, has not yet prompted the financial sector to improve reporting quality; however, normative pressure has had significant influence in influencing FIs’ CSR practices, with China’s banks potentially taking a leading role. Originality/value: The financial sector has a lower direct environmental impact than traditional polluting industries and different operating and reporting structures, features often used to argue for its exclusion in prior studies. However, its indirect environmental impact via lending and investing activities is significant, suggesting evidence on the determinants of sustainability disclosure quality is required. This study uses evidence from China’s financial sector to reduce this gap in the literature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",China; Csr Disclosures; Financial Sector; Institutional Theory; Multiple Regression Modeling,,,"Alberici, Adalberto, The Quality of Disclosures on Environmental Policy: The Profile of Financial Intermediaries, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 23, 5, pp. 283-296, (2016); Amores-Salvadó, Javier, Green corporate image: Moderating the connection between environmental product innovation and firm performance, Journal of Cleaner Production, 83, pp. 356-365, (2014); Amran, Azlan Bin, Evidence in development of sustainability reporting: A case of a developing country, Business Strategy and the Environment, 20, 3, pp. 141-156, (2011); Andrikopoulos, Andreas, Corporate social responsibility reporting in financial institutions: Evidence from Euronext, Research in International Business and Finance, 32, pp. 27-35, (2014); Bonifácio Neto, J., Controversial sectors in banks’ sustainability reporting, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 26, 6, pp. 495-505, (2019); Bose, Sudipta, What drives green banking disclosure?

We find that, unlike country-level GHG targets, reductions in a portfolio's financed emissions has little direct relation to changes in physical emissions; over a 95% reduction in financed emissions can be achieved using industry-standard methods even while physical emissions from a portfolio's companies are increasing. This creates a substantial risk of misaligning portfolios – and investment decisions – to climate mitigation efforts and net-zero commitments. We analyse the different financed emission definitions and targets currently in use and suggest alternative means by which investors can credibly align their portfolios with the transition to a low-carbon economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Finance; Low-carbon Transition; Net-zero; Transition Risks; Carbon; Economics; Environmental Management; Greenhouse Gases; Investments; Renewable Energy Resources; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty Analysis; % Reductions; Financial Institution; Financial Investors; Financial Risks; Investments Portfolios; Low Carbon Economy; Low-carbon Transitions; Net-zero; Task Force; Transition Risk; Climate Change; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Emission Control; Environmental Economics; Finance; Greenhouse Gas; Investment,Carbon; Economics; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; % reductions; Financial institution; Financial investors; Financial risks; Investments portfolios; Low carbon economy; Low-carbon transitions; Net-zero; Task force; Transition risk; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental economics; finance; greenhouse gas; investment,"The measurement and disclosure of financed emissions is supported by industry bodies globally, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) ( TCFD, 2021b ), the UN Net Zero Coalition ( UNEPFI, 2022a ), and over 300 institutions (with US$81.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM)) through the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) ( PCAF, 2020, 2022 ).

Based on extensive empirical studies on how different strategies deliver on this impact premise, it recommends changing the current strategy mix from a focus on exclusion to shareholder engagement. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an extensive review of the SRI literature, various SRI strategies are theoretically evaluated. Subsequently, an example of a bank that applies a sophisticated engagement strategy is presented. Findings: It is shown that there are indeed severe differences in the effects of exclusion, positive approaches and shareholder engagement. Impact-oriented investment products should use engagement strategies. Practical implications: By providing an empirically based rationale for shareholder engagement, this article gives those who practice it a moral and economic justification. Instead of having to defend why there are seemingly unethical companies in their portfolio, they can go on the offense and counter that the “pure” role models are actually “impact washers”. Social implications: By emphasizing the primacy of the impact of investment products, the transmission mechanism of the capital market to create positive change for the environment and society is strengthened. This should lead to improvements in both areas. Originality/value: While there are some other studies that examine investor impact in some way, they often do so in a context that is unrelated of sustainable investments. This study structures the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of exclusion, positive approaches and shareholder engagement and provides a recommended course of action for investors and policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Exclusion; Impact Generation; Impact Investing; Shareholder Engagement; Sustainable Investments,,The author would like to acknowledge two anonymous reviewers for their views and comments.

Mobilization of finances through products such as green loans, green bonds, green mortgages, green deposits, etc., to fund green projects is necessary for creating a green economy. Thus, this paper aims to develop an understanding of these various green finance products that channelize finance into green endeavours. For this, the paper identifies green finance products developed by public and private financial institutions and groups them into categories: credit-based green products for consumers, investment funding, and green insurance. To understand the practicality of these products the paper shows how a few Asian countries like China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines have created green financing channels. We also shed light on the stature of green finance in India and the many challenges it has been facing. Numerous barriers like lack of awareness and slow rate of returns in investments on green projects hinder bringing green finance products into the mainstream. We conclude that there is a need for better collaboration with international private and public investors to stimulate global investment in green finance products to achieve a greener economy in India. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Landscape of Green Finance in India, (2020); Agliardi, Elettra, Financing environmentally-sustainable projects with green bonds, Environment and Development Economics, 24, 6, pp. 608-623, (2019); undefined, (2020); Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019, (2019); Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2021, (2021); undefined, (2015); undefined, (2017); Green Bond Market in the Nordics 2018, (2018); CBI and Asia Development Bank, (2019); undefined, (2020)",,Springer Nature,,,9789819922062; 9789819922055,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202133080,

How to measure the overall ESG performance of a bank, considering both direct and indirect impacts? This study proposes a new indicator, the BESGI score (Banks' Environmental, Social, Governance and Indirect Impacts). Compared to other more traditional ESG scores, the model a) is bank-specific, b) is based on public data and then highly replicable, c) it can assess the level of a bank's sustainability both in its internal processes and procedures and in its choices about financing and investing activities, and d) is based on an innovative aggregation methodology, the Multidimensional Synthesis of Indicators, to consider the synergies among dimensions and penalize heterogeneity in the multidimensional bank results. We offer both a theoretical and an empirical contribution. First, the novel scoring model is presented, with indicators validated by practitioners and a theoretical framework rooted in organisational facades and legitimacy, signalling, and institutional theories. Secondly, we apply the BESGI scoring model to significant European banks and analyse its main determinants. Our results show relevant opportunities for banks to improve towards an overall and multi-comprehensive sustainability, especially concerning social measures and a higher focus on indirect impacts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banks; Esg; Europe; Finance; Impact Assessment; Indirect Impacts; Sustainability; Finance; Environmentally Responsible; Esg; Europe; External Pressures; Financial System; Impact Assessments; Indirect Impact; Internal Pressures; Scoring Models; Sustainability Performance; Sustainable Development; Banking; Finance; Financial System; Performance Assessment; Social Impact Assessment; Sustainability,Finance; Environmentally responsible; ESG; Europe; External pressures; Financial system; Impact assessments; Indirect impact; Internal pressures; Scoring models; Sustainability performance; Sustainable development; banking; finance; financial system; performance assessment; social impact assessment; sustainability,,"Oxford Handbook of Organizational Decision Making, (2008); Adams, Carol A., Internal organisational factors influencing corporate social and ethical reporting: Beyond current theorising, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 15, 2, pp. 223-250, (2002); Aerts, Walter, Intra-industry imitation in corporate environmental reporting: An international perspective, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 25, 3, pp. 299-331, (2006); Albarrak, Mohammed S., The effect of carbon dissemination on cost of equity, Business Strategy and the Environment, 28, 6, pp. 1179-1198, (2019); Bai, Yu, Visualizing environmental management: Corporate environmental images information disclosure and idiosyncratic risk, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 99, (2023); Baker, Andrew M., Investigating how word-of-mouth conversations about brands influence purchase and retransmission intentions, Journal of Marketing Research, 53, 2, pp. 225-239, (2016); Ball, Amanda, Using neo-institutionalism to advance social and environmental accounting, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 21, 4, pp. 283-293, (2010); Journal of Accountancy, (2006); Bartolacci, Francesca, A Systematic Literature Review of Theories Underpinning Sustainability Reporting in Non-financial Disclosure, SIDREA Series in Accounting and Business Administration, Part F28, pp. 87-113, (2022); Bellucci, Marco, Performance Measurement In Solidarity Economy Organizations: The Case Of Fair Trade Shops In Italy, Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 83, 1, pp. 25-59, (2012)",,Elsevier Inc.,,01959255,9024727650; 9789024727650,EIARD,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165885913,

Within the stream of climate finance, the global initiatives for corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environment, social and governance (ESG) practices have had important roles in leveraging firms to become more actively involved in environment-related disclosure, in which climate risk reporting is central to evaluating whether and to what extent a firm and its operations are friendly to the environment. Along with the growth of the UN Principles for Responsible Investing in 2005, one of the most recent global initiatives that has been formed is the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which has considered the climate-related financial disclosure recommendations of G20 finance ministers. Given that TCFD recommendations have recently been released for a broad domain of players (such as banks, investors, insurers and governments) in various countries (e.g., New Zealand, the United States and Japan), we surveyed the most recent studies on the TCFD by using a conceptual framework for climate-related disclosures focusing on studies published worldwide. On the basis of a thorough review, we highlight the essential functions of financial markets and also provide the critical implications for different market players ranging from providers to supporters of the TCFD. Our study offers a timely conceptual review of the TCFD which is critical for stimulating sustainable investments, climate finance and enhanced corporate reporting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Disclosure; Climate Risk; Conceptual Analysis; Reporting; Sustainability Initiatives; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Economics; Finance; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations,climate change; climate effect; economics; finance; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations,"Open access publishing facilitated by Massey University, as part of the Wiley - Massey University agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians.","Glocality, (2021); Amar, Jeanne, Enhancing Financial Transparency to Mitigate Climate Change: Toward a Climate Risks and Opportunities Reporting Index, Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 27, 3, pp. 425-439, (2022); Ameli, Nadia, Climate finance and disclosure for institutional investors: why transparency is not enough, Climatic Change, 160, 4, pp. 565-589, (2020); Arabadzhyan, Anastasia, Climate change, coastal tourism, and impact chains–a literature review, Current Issues in Tourism, 24, 16, pp. 2233-2268, (2021); Aragón, Fernando M.

This paper contributes threefold. First, using a supply and demand-based pricing model, we propose a new model of the expected return, risk, and performance ratio of the ESG premiums defined by the log price differences between ESG indexes and a market portfolio to analyze how ESG investments perform. Second, based on the empirical findings of this study that the correlation between ESG indexes and energy prices is a decreasing function of the latter in contrast to other environmental assets, this paper suggests that ESG indexes cannot adequately demonstrate environmental values but reflect social and governance values, i.e., (E)SG, in the complementary perspective. Third, using the empirical findings of this study that the information ratio of the ESG premium tends to be positive but declines and approaches zero over time, this paper indicates that although ESG investments can be significant compared to market index investments, the significance is limited because ESG investment performance converges with market portfolio performance. In conclusion, two points should be noted about ESG investing in clean energy policy: given the dilution of environmental values in ESG investing, a clear distinction should be made between ESG investing and renewable energy investing; even if investments in renewable energy projects are treated as ESG investments, reflecting current market trends, we should be prepared for the fact that the superior investment performance due to social and governance values, rather than environmental values, will not last long. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Clean Energy Policy; Energy-environment Linkage; Esg Index; Esg Premium; Information Ratio; Alternative Energy; Correlation; Demand Analysis; Energy Market; Energy Policy; Environmental Values; Investment,alternative energy; correlation; demand analysis; energy market; energy policy; environmental values; investment,,"Ashwin Kumar, N.

Many initiatives have been undertaken to implement different policies and plans in this regard, which require considerable mobilisation of national and international financing. In acquiring climate finance, many barriers can be identified. This paper aims to investigate such barriers to climate financing in Sri Lanka and proposes strategies to address them. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research approach was undertaken in this study by conducting ten semi-structured interviews with experts who are involved in climate change policy implementation activities in Sri Lanka. The collected data were analysed using the content analysis method via Nvivo software. Findings: The empirical findings unveil six key barriers and the corresponding root causes to climate financing in Sri Lanka. Inadequate domestic funding for climate actions was captured as the dominant barrier in this direction. This study also revealed that barriers and their root causes are interconnected, leading to many financial limitations in implementing climate actions. The importance of playing a leading role by the government and enabling an integrated approach between the private and public sector organisations were identified as key strategies to combat climate finance barriers. Originality/value: Despite there being studies focusing on climate change and related policies, limited research has been carried out with regard to climate financing. Within this context, this study makes an original contribution in the area of climate financing with particular reference to a developing country like Sri Lanka. Further, the identification of barriers to climate financing, their root causes and strategies to address them also provides an original contribution to theory and practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Barriers; Climate Actions; Climate Change; Climate Change Policy Implementations; Climate Finance; Strategies,,This work was supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Grant ES/T003219/1 entitled “Technology Enhanced Stakeholder Collaboration for Supporting Risk-Sensitive Sustainable Urban Development”.,"Journal of Geoscience and Environment Protection, (2014); International Journal of Education, (2017); English Linguistics Research, (2014); Challenges Ahead Climate Change in the Context of Weak Institutions Rome, (2020); Barriers to Successful Climate Change Policy Implementation in Tanzania, (2016); Biesbroek, Robbert, Barriers to climate change adaptation in the Netherlands, Climate Law, 2, 2, pp. 181-199, (2011); Sri Lanka National Scoping Study, (2017); National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change Impacts in Sri Lanka 2016 2025, (2016); De Costa, Janendra, Climate change in Sri Lanka: Myth or reality?

Thus, rising economic imbalances constitute a significant drag on China's economy's potential for expansion. Thus, understanding the forces and reducing the imbalance between development and ecology is imperative. For this purpose, the present study is conducted to ascertain the role of Natural Resources (NTR), Economic development (ECD), Renewable Energy (REN), and Clean Technology (TEC) on Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through a cutting-edge timeseries estimation technique of a Quantile Autoregressive Distribution Lag (QARDL). The reported results revealed the positive relationships of NTR and ECD with GHG, whereas REN and TEC are found to reduce the level of GHG. Based on the findings and the declining trend in the growth of the Chinese economy, it is recommended to take sustainable initiatives to balance the imbalance between ecology and development sustainably. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Clean Technology; Economic Development; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Natural Resources; Qardl; Renewable Energy; Economic And Social Effects; Expansion; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Natural Resources; Renewable Energy Resources; Auto-regressive; Case-studies; Clean Technologies; Economic Development; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Natural Resource Economics; Natural Resource Utilization; Quantile Autoregressive Distribution Lag; Renewable Energies; Renewable Technology; Ecology; Alternative Energy; Carbon Emission; Economic Development; Emission Control; Greenhouse Gas; Natural Resource; China,Economic and social effects; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Auto-regressive; Case-studies; Clean technologies; Economic development; Greenhouse gas emissions; Natural resource economics; Natural resource utilization; Quantile autoregressive distribution lag; Renewable energies; Renewable technology; Ecology; alternative energy; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; greenhouse gas; natural resource; China,"Funding text 1: Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number ( PNURSP2023R261 ), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia .This research is funded by Thuongmai University, Hanoi, Vietnam .; Funding text 2: This research is funded by Thuongmai University, Hanoi, Vietnam.Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2023R261), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Environment risk is one which is related to unexpected pollutants occurring subsequently of natural disasters such as tornadoes, floods, wildfire etc. exposing risks to property and life. As per study it has been found that the severity and frequency of such risk will continue to increase in coming years [2]. The exposure to these environmental risks leads to loss of property and life, wherein crucial role of insurance markets as mediator is required [22]. The Insurance industry is needed to refine the insurance policies according to the volatile events occurring in the environment. Moreover, Environment risk is drawing attention of various researchers and insurance companies for mitigating such risks so as to ensure sustain standards for insurance markets. This paper is an attempt to compile comprehensive summary regarding environmental risk, climate change their influence over insurance industry. Furthermore, the study would pave a way for future researchers in developing better understanding among the decision makers so that they can develop such policies which will mitigate such risk and ensure sustainable standards for insurance industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Risks; Insurance Sector; Mitigation Etc; Sustainability,,,"Crnčevič, Tijana, Displacement and climate change: improving planning policy and increasing community resilience, International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management, 10, 1, pp. 105-120, (2018); Impact of Climate Change on the Uk Insurance Sector, (2015); Collier, Stephen J., Governing urban resilience: Insurance and the problematization of climate change, Economy and Society, 50, 2, pp. 275-296, (2021); Basoeki, Agastyo Djanardono, Sustainable Development on Indonesian Environmental Risk Assessment, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 819, 1, (2021); Byrne, John B., An equity- and sustainability-based policy response to global climate change, Energy Policy, 26, 4, pp. 335-343, (1998); Cannon, Clare E.B., The climate change double whammy: Flood damage and the determinants of flood insurance coverage, the case of post-Katrina New Orleans, Climate Risk Management, 27, (2020); Economy and Society, (2021); Dlugolecki, Andrew F., Climate Change and the Insurance Industry, Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, 25, 4, pp. 582-601, (2000); Engle, Robert F., Hedging climate change news, Review of Financial Studies, 33, 3, pp. 1184-1216, (2020); Gatzert, Nadine, Sustainability risks & opportunities in the insurance industry, Zeitschrift fur die gesamte Versicherungswissenschaft, 109, 5, pp. 311-331, (2020)",,wiley,,,9781394166510; 9781394167944,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168616642,

Thereby, they can analyze the resilience of their firm towards long-term risks, and opportunities. It is therefore, the concept of ESG investment has emerged as one of the most sustainable practices for the firm's survival and thus handling the challenge of climate change and risks involved in the business and hence turning it into opportunities. Apart from the adoption of sustainable business models and thus contributing to the global mission of low carbon emission economy, companies are now drifting their focus towards green economy. Since, insurance industry is one point solution to every business by handling risk in a much efficient manner; by offering provisions of insurance coverage; acting as risk experts thus accessing risks (policy, litigation, market and technological risk) involved in the business and hence is contributing significantly in the field of climate sustainability, and facilitating green investment.

This chapter shows how convoluted and conflicting the connection between insurers and climate change is, despite insurance's key position in the economy. To follow up on the concept of insurers as risk shapers due to climate change (the first section of the chapter), In the second part of this chapter, we see how insurers have contributed significantly to the acceleration of fossil fuel-based economic expansion and growth, hence contributing to climate change and the associated climatic risks that have arisen since industrialization; This is the most crucial facet of the insurance industry's engagement with global warming. Chapter 3 examines how insurers have reacted to rising climate risk over the last decade. Most actions have taken an adaptive approach, with the goal of making insurers better able to deal with the climate risks they expose their clients. Some measures have been ""weakly mitigative,"" meaning they provide for some mitigation, but on a very limited scale, and mostly as side effects of activities not directly connected to climate change. To the contrary, as discussed in the fourth part, only a small handful of recent ""divest and decline"" activities by players in the insurance business can be classified as ""highly mitigative."" The chapter comes to a close with some concluding thoughts on the role of insurers as governors of security outside the state and the likelihood of more substantial mitigation measures by insurers on climate change. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Change; Climate; Insurance; Market; Sustainability,,,"Ma, Xuejiao, How to balance the trade-offbetween economic development and climate change?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 6, (2019); Luu, The Anh, Farmers' intention to climate change adaptation in agriculture in the Red River Delta Biosphere Reserve (Vietnam): A combination of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 10, (2019); Dlugolecki, Andrew F., Climate Change and the Insurance Industry, Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, 25, 4, pp. 582-601, (2000); Krauss, Adam D., Effect of climate change on the insurance sector, pp. 397-436, (2021); Climate Change 2007 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2007); Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Insurance Regulation, (2008); Economy and Society, (2021); Climate Change Risk Assessment for the Insurance Industry, (2021); Bate, Bate Godwill, Determinants and policy implications of farmers' climate adaptation choices in rural Cameroon, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 7, (2019); Iais Sif, (2018)",,wiley,,,9781394166510; 9781394167944,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168595473,

As the world has been continuously striving to reduce its complete dependency on paperwork to combat deforestation, water pollution, security risks, and ensure sustainable development. This study merges scholarly opinions with what is the scope of the digital insurance world under the principles of sustainable insurance, and whether digital insurance can ensure sustainability. The digitization of the insurance platform addresses the most significant answers to problems such as how to bring down the paperwork to zero, ensure the complete system is eco-friendly, bring every important stakeholder online, bridge the gap between development in the insurance sector without compromising with natural resources, and how close we can go to ensure sustainable development with insurance sustainability principles. The digitization of insurance operations welcomes sustainability and helps in meeting sustainable development goals. However, there are certain challenges before the entire insurance industry that cannot be ignored at any cost to ensure sustainability. This practical aspect highlights the key transforming scenario via the digital platform for insurance companies and explains how being digital can bring forth the merger of sustainability with expanding digital ecosystem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Digital Insurance; Digitization; Ecology; Sustainability; Sustainable Goals,,,"What is the Cost of Paper in Any Business, (2022); Insurance 2020 the Digital Prize Taking Customer Connection to A New Level, (2020); Cebulsky, Michael, The digital insurance - facing customer expectation in a rapidly changing world, pp. 359-370, (2017); Insurance Beyond Digital the Rise of Ecosystems and Platforms, (2018); American Journal of Economics and Business Administration, (2020); Ghobakhloo, Morteza, The future of manufacturing industry: a strategic roadmap toward Industry 4.0, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 29, 6, pp. 910-936, (2018); Eling, Martin, The Impact of Digitalization on the Insurance Value Chain and the Insurability of Risks, Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, 43, 3, pp. 359-396, (2018); Schroeder, Andreas, Capturing the benefits of industry 4.0: a business network perspective, Production Planning and Control, 30, 16, pp. 1305-1321, (2019); Digital Insurance Platform Market, (2021); Insurance 4 0 Benefits and Challenges of Digital Transformation, (2021)",,wiley,,,9781394166510; 9781394167944,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168573308,

Yet, fund-level climate-related disclosures have focused on portfolio holdings, reducing the ability of investors to evaluate the impact of capital flows. In particular, as passive funds grow, there is a risk that capital is channelled into carbon-intensive assets through primary markets. To track carbon-intensive portfolio holdings and primary market transactions, and the role of passive funds within them, we construct a dataset of daily holdings for passive U.S. corporate bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from 2016 to 2021. We find that the carbon exposure and carbon intensity of ETF primary market transactions are associated with existing ETF portfolio holdings. We also find that the share of secondary market holdings and primary market transactions accounted for by passive ETFs is higher for fossil fuel bonds, and increases with bond-level carbon intensity. These findings indicate that the continued growth in passive funds could support carbon-intensive capital flows. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Capital Flows; Climate Finance; Divestment; Fossil Fuels; Passive Investing; Capital Flow; Carbon Emission; Data Set; Economic Growth; Finance; Fossil Fuel; Market System; Trade-environment Relations; United States,capital flow; carbon emission; data set; economic growth; finance; fossil fuel; market system; trade-environment relations; United States,The authors thank team members of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier drafts of the paper.,"Ssrn Electron J, (2018); International Finance Discussion Paper, (2018); Anadu, Kenechukwu, The Shift from Active to Passive Investing: Risks to Financial Stability?, Financial Analysts Journal, 76, 4, pp. 23-39, (2020); Mostly Harmless Econometrics an Empiricist S Companion, (2009); Stranded Assets and the Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign What does Divestment Mean for the Valuation of Fossil Fuel Assets, (2013); Appel, Ian R., Passive investors, not passive owners, Journal of Financial Economics, 121, 1, pp. 111-141, (2016); Bahra, Bhupinder, ESG in global corporate bonds: The analysis behind the hype, Journal of Portfolio Management, 46, 8, pp. 133-147, (2020); Baines, Joseph, From passive owners to planet savers?

Consumers are misled towards demand of unsustainable and inadequately priced food products by an insufficient internalization of externalities. Shifting demand towards more sustainable dietary choices can lead to a sustainable transition of agri-food networks. In this study, we evaluate environmental damage economically: we combine environmental assessment of different food products with the internalization of their monetary impacts. Life Cycle Assessments are modeled for conventional and organic foods and different production scenarios. The quantified environmental impacts are combined with True Cost Accounting to adjust food prices according to their environmental impacts. Using this framework for 22 German agricultural products, we find that on average, crop production generates externalities of about €0.79 per kg for conventional and about €0.42 for organic products. Conventional milk and eggs cause additional costs of about €1.29 per kg on average in organic systems and about €1.10 in organic ones.

In this article, we develop a critical review of the empirical and theoretical literature concerning the impact of climate-related risks on the price of financial assets. We first present the theoretical links between asset pricing and climate-related risks and develop a theory of how climate risk drivers transmit costs to firms and lead to asset price changes. We then discuss studies looking at past climate-related events, which show that both climate physical impacts and transition dynamics can trigger a revaluation of financial assets through multiple direct and indirect channels. Finally, we review the emerging literature that uses forward-looking methodologies to estimate future climate-related asset price changes, which suggests that climate financial risks can indeed have significant implications on financial stability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Asset Pricing; Climate Change; Climate-related Financial Risks; Financial Stability; Low-carbon Transition; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Environmental Economics; Financial Market; Price Dynamics,carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; financial market; price dynamics,"Funding text 1: A previous version of this article has benefited from the financial support of WWF Switzerland.

This study provides a first quantitative assessment of biodiversity risk exposure across the world's largest listed companies, compared with their adoption of biodiversity policies, through analysis of disclosures from a sample of 11,812 companies from 2004 to 2018. We find that companies have started responding strategically to biodiversity risk, with 29% having adopted a biodiversity policy by 2018. However, around $7.2 trillion of total enterprise value remains exposed to unmanaged biodiversity risk. Companies in sectors with material impacts on biodiversity tend to have high levels of response, but there is poorer responsiveness to material biodiversity dependency risks.

Using 60 stakeholder interviews with senior real estate executives, this paper examines the strategic issues regarding benchmarking ESG in real estate investment; specifically, identifying areas going forward where ESG benchmarks need to be improved. This includes the issues of granularity, climate resilience and climate risk, as well as an increased focus on outcomes and performance, and using best practice procedures in delivering ESG in real estate investment. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 60 stakeholder interviews were conducted with key real estate players globally to assess the use of ESG benchmarking in real estate investment at various levels (asset/fund-level, listed real estate, delivery, reporting and internal benchmarking), across regions and across different types of real estate investment players (real estate fund manager, real estate investment trust (REIT), institutional investor and real estate advisor). This enabled key strategic insights to be identified for improved ESG benchmarking practices in real estate investment going forward. Findings: There was clear evidence of the need for improved benchmarks for ESG in real estate investment. More focus was needed on performance, outcomes and impacts, with a stronger focus on granularity around the issues of climate resilience and climate risk. Improvements in Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), as well as increased attention to Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) were seen as important initiatives. Clear differences were also seen in the use of these ESG benchmarks on a regional basis; with Australia and Europe seen as the world leaders. These strategic stakeholder insights regarding ESG saw the development of best practice guidelines for the more effective delivery of ESG benchmarks for more informed real estate investment decision-making, as well as a series of recommendations for improving ESG benchmarking in real estate investment. Practical implications: ESG benchmarking is a critical area of real estate investment decision-making today. By utilising stakeholder interviews, the strategic insights from key players in the real estate investment space are identified. In particular, this paper identifies how the current ESG benchmarks used in real estate investment need to be improved for a more critical assessment of climate resilience and climate risk issues at a more granular level. This enables the identification and delivery of more effective ESG best practice procedures and recommendations for improving ESG benchmarking in real estate investment going forward. These issues have clear impacts on ongoing capital raisings by investors, where benchmarking ESG is an increasingly important factor for real estate investors, tenants and real estate asset managers. Originality/value: Based on the stakeholder interview responses, this paper has identified key areas for improvement in the current benchmarks for ESG in real estate investment. It is anticipated that an increased focus on technology and the availability of more granular data, coupled with user demand, will see more focus on assessing performance, outcomes and impacts at a real estate asset-specific level and produce a fuller range of ESG metrics, more focused on climate resilience and climate risk. This will see a more effective range of ESG benchmarks for more informed real estate investment decision-making. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Resilience And Climate Risk; Esg Benchmarks; Granularity; Gresb; Real Estate Investment; Tcfd,,The authors acknowledge Investment Property Forum (IPF) for their support of this research project.,"Aprea Esg Guidebook for Real Assets in Asia Pacific, (2022); 2018 Gresb Survey Consultation Response, (2018); How Sustainable Investment Improves Real Estate Performance, (2019); Cajias, Marcelo, Do responsible real estate companies outperform their peers?, International Journal of Strategic Property Management, 18, 1, pp. 11-27, (2014); Asia Pacific Sustainable City Ranking, (2022); Climate Risk and Commercial Property Values A Review and Analysis of the Literature, (2021); Clayton, Jim, Climate risk and real estate prices: What do we know?, Journal of Portfolio Management, 47, 10, pp. 75-90, (2021); Cradduck, Lucy Margaret, Development in a state of climate change: an Australian case study of government response, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 40, 4, pp. 362-380, (2022); Cradduck, Lucy Margaret, Courts’ views on climate change inundation risks for developments: Australian perspectives and considerations for valuers, Journal of European Real Estate Research, 13, 3, pp. 435-453, (2020); de Francesco, Anthony J., The impact of sustainability on the investment environment, Journal of European Real Estate Research, 1, 1, pp. 72-87, (2008)",,Emerald Publishing,,1463578X,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150718628,

Design/methodology/approach: Thirty Australian valuer members of the Australian Property Institute from a variety of specialisations were interviewed. The semi-structured interviews explored climate change risks and the extent of risk investigation and consideration in valuation practice. The analysis utilised the Moser and Luers (2008) climate risk preparedness framework as a lens to evaluate current valuation practice in Australia. Findings: The analysis reflects that while physical risks are easily identified and engaged with by valuers, correspondingly, there is a lack of understanding of and engagement with, climate change risks. This supports the need for better information sources and guidance to inform valuers of climate change risks and the development of specific mechanisms for the consideration of such risks to be included in valuation processes, practices and reports. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited by its sample size and qualitative approach. Therefore, the research is not a representative opinion of the Australian profession; however, the analysis provides the perspective of a range of valuers from across Australia with different valuation specialisations. Practical implications: This research has established that valuers have the potential to be prepared to address climate change in their professional capacity, as described by Moser and Luers (2008). However, they are constrained by information communication, access and detail and subsequent market awareness of information on climate change risk exposure on properties. There is a need for further support, guidance, information and tools, as well as awareness-raising, to enable valuers to accurately identify and reflect all risks affecting a property in the process of valuation. Originality/value: This research provides the first investigation into the consideration of climate change in valuation practice. Property stakeholders—owners, investors, financiers and occupiers—are escalating their climate change risk analysis and reporting for property portfolios and organisations. This research suggests that valuers also need to be aware of the changing dynamics of market reporting and decision-making related to climate change risks to ensure appropriate reflection in valuation practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Due Diligence; Preparedness; Risk; Valuation; Valuers,,The authors would like to acknowledge the funding provided by the Australian Property Research and Education Fund (Australian Property Institute) and the research assistance provided by Dr Monique Schmidt and Laura Cutroni.,"Anzvtip 11 Valuation Procedures Real Property, (2019); Black Summer Bushfires, (2021); Draft Cpg 229 Climate Change Financial Risks, (2021); Apra Finalises Prudential Guidance on Managing the Financial Risks of Climate Change, (2021); Apra Publishes Findings of Latest Climate Risk Self Assessment Survey, (2022); Information Paper Climate Risk Self Assessment Survey, (2022); Baldauf, Markus, Does climate change affect real estate prices? only if you believe in it, Review of Financial Studies, 33, 3, pp. 1256-1295, (2020); Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon Climate Change and Financial Stability, (2015); Climate Risk and Commercial Property Values A Review and Analysis of the Literature, (2021); Clayton, Jim, Climate risk and real estate prices: What do we know?, Journal of Portfolio Management, 47, 10, pp. 75-90, (2021)",,Emerald Publishing,,1463578X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149706614,

From the Paris Agreement to the change of administration in the United States, the wind suddenly seems to be blowing in the opposite direction, and many banks change course. The UN-convened Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) is one prominent example of this new trend. However, banks are only one part of this complex and varied landscape of global finance, which, among institutional investors, includes investment funds, hedge funds, mutual funds, insurance funds, pension plans and ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Despite the promise to divest or reduce investments, global finance still holds profound ties with the fossil fuel sector. The high energy prices due to the war in the Ukraine and concerns over energy security are seemingly strengthening these ties. We provide an insight of the complexity of these interlinkages and explain to what extent the domain of public governance is trying to exert (still insufficient) control over the financial sector under the scope of climate mitigation policies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Decarbonization; Finance; Fossil Fuels,,,"undefined, (2025); undefined, (2022); Bebbington, Jan, Accounting and accountability in the Anthropocene, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 33, 1, pp. 152-177, (2020); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2020); undefined, (2022); Financ Times, (2022); Busch, Danny, EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, Capital Markets Law Journal, 18, 3, pp. 303-328, (2023); Carbon Brief, (2021); Chenet, Hugues, Finance, climate-change and radical uncertainty: Towards a precautionary approach to financial policy, Ecological Economics, 183, (2021); Chiarucci, Riccardo, Evidences for a structural change in the oil market before a financial crisis: The flat horizon effect, Research in International Business and Finance, 42, pp. 912-921, (2017)",,Elsevier B.V.,,26667916,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178108472,

Then, the aim of this letter consists of analyzing investors’ preferences about investment funds which investment policy contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6: “clean water and sanitation”, given the global importance of achieving this goal. To do that, a survey was carried out in which a total of 456 valid observations were obtained. Choice experiment methodology has been applied to try to obtain a valuation by Spanish investors. The results show that there is a high valuation of funds whose portfolios include investments that contribute to SDG 6 and that there is also heterogeneity in preferences.

The sample selection method used purposive sampling, which used several criteria with the research object being the Mining industry listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and the National Center for Sustainability Reporting (NCSR) in 2020-2021. The data were sourced from secondary materials derived from several mining companies. The research employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for data analysis. The results of the study indicate that: (1) CSR has a significant positive effect on SDGs; (2) SDGs have a significant positive effect on financial performance; (3) CSR has a significant positive effect on financial performance; and (4) SDGs can mediate CSR and financial performance. Companies should consider enhancing their CSR disclosure, as it is positively related to SDG achievement and financial performance. Moreover, regulatory bodies may encourage firms to adopt SDGs as part of their CSR initiatives, which could lead to both societal and economic benefits. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Csr; Financial Performance; Mining Industry; Sdg,,,"Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Globalization of Law and Local Wisdom Icglow 2019, (2019); Journal of Sustainability and Green Business, (2012); Aggarwal, Priyanka, CSR and sustainability reporting practices in India: an in-depth content analysis of top-listed companies, Social Responsibility Journal, 15, 8, pp. 1033-1053, (2019); Ahmad, Maaz, Is achieving environmental sustainability dependent on information communication technology and globalization?

In particular, the financial sector is expected to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as it plays a critical role in promoting sustainable development through its key roles as risk managers, insurers, investors and lenders. It has been acknowledged that the sector has the power to direct investments towards sustainable activities, encourage sustainable business practices, and promote sustainable development more broadly. However, for MNEs, including insurance companies, examining sustainability practices across subsidiaries operating in expanded geographic contexts becomes complex. Implementing corporate sustainability strategies is challenging, particularly when their globally-developed strategy intersects with local operations. However, limited attention has been given to the sustainability practices adopted by the financial sector at the subsidiary or local levels. This study aims to fill this gap by examining how multinational insurance companies operating in emerging markets manage their sustainability practices, particularly in aligning their global sustainability strategy with local operations. Utilising a corporate sustainability assessment process framework and focusing on the case study context of Allianz in Malaysia, this study provides a comprehensive picture not only of the sustainability practices that have been implemented but also of the important role that global and local operations play in translating global strategies to achieve sustainability into meaningful and contextualised local agendas for sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Asia Pacific; Corporate Sustainability; Corporate Sustainability Assessment; Developing Countries; Financial Sector; Mne; Sustainable Development; Un Sdgs; Advocacy; Corporate Strategy; Developing World; Financial Services; Foreign Direct Investment; Multinational Enterprise; Sustainable Development Goal; Malaysia,advocacy; corporate strategy; developing world; financial services; foreign direct investment; multinational enterprise; Sustainable Development Goal; Malaysia,,"Sustainable Development Goals, (2015); Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2020, (2020); van Zanten, Jan Anton, Multinational enterprises and the Sustainable Development Goals: An institutional approach to corporate engagement, Journal of International Business Policy, 1, 3-4, pp. 208-233, (2018); Brammer, Steve J., Corporate social responsibility and institutional theory: New perspectives on private governance, Socio-Economic Review, 10, 1, pp. 3-28, (2012); Borgert, Thomas, Initiating sustainability assessments: Insights from practice on a procedural perspective, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 72, pp. 99-107, (2018); Ike, Masayoshi, A holistic perspective on corporate sustainability from a management viewpoint: Evidence from Japanese manufacturing multinational enterprises, Journal of Cleaner Production, 216, pp. 139-151, (2019); Burritt, Roger Leonard, Multinational Enterprise Strategies for Addressing Sustainability: the Need for Consolidation, Journal of Business Ethics, 164, 2, pp. 389-410, (2020); Shapiro, Daniel M., Natural resources, multinational enterprises and sustainable development, Journal of World Business, 53, 1, pp. 1-14, (2018); Thien, George Ted Khiong, CSR for clients' social/environmental impacts?, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 22, 2, pp. 83-94, (2015); Unep Fi Annual Overview 20192020, (2020)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163108466,

The aim is to understand the relationship between democracy and the financial market, in the context of a hyper-complex society and the global market economy, analyzing specifically: (i) - the functioning of the financial market from the theories of Economic Democracy, which reflect decision-making process in business activity; (ii) - the liability of the administrator and manager of investment funds in the incorporation of ESG criteria and the fiduciary duty. The inductive method is employed with the aid of bibliographical research. It is concluded that: 1 - the ASG criteria, representative of the cooperation between State-Company to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), do not contribute directly to the democratization of the financial market, but indirectly, since there is an introduction of cooperation procedures that promote transparency and dialogue, such as disclosure, which publicly address environmental, social and governance issues, essential themes for democracy in the current molds; 2 - legal responsibility on the incorporation of ESG criteria and the choice of assets should not be limited to the risk-return criterion, since there is a new regulatory universe that applies to the actions of investment fund managers/administrators, such as transnational standards, which include a new ethics aimed at SDGs, which are complementary to traditional fiduciary duties. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business; Economic Democracy; Esg; Human Rights; Investment Funds; Sustainable Development,,,"Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); Retrato Da Sustentabilidade no Mercado De Capitais; Guia Asg Incorporacao Dos Aspectos Asg Nas Analises De Investimento, (2020); Guia Asg II Incorporacao Dos Aspectos Asg Nas Analises De Investimento; Regras E Procedimentos Para Identificacao De Fundos De Investimento Sustentavel is; Revista De Direito Bancario E do Mercado De Capitais, (2021); Revista Dos Tribunais, (2022); Globalizacao Empresa Transnacional E Direitos Humanos, (2021); Soberania E Constituicao Para Uma Critica do Constitucionalismo, (2008); Mercado De Capitais E Ods, (2018)",,Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana,,2179345X; 21798214,,,,Portuguese,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186468561,

Here we conduct semi-structured interviews with asset managers, corporations and restoration finance experts to examine incentives and barriers to private restoration finance. Next, we assess what type of restoration projects and regions appeal to different private funders and how current financial barriers can be overcome. We show that market incentives for corporations include meeting net-emission-reduction commitments, impact and sustainable branding opportunities, and promotion of sustainability in supply chains. Conversely, asset managers face stronger barriers to investing in restoration as it is deemed a high-risk, unknown investment with low profitability. We find that investment finance biases towards restoration projects in low-risk areas and corporate finance towards areas with business presence. Both private finance types tend to omit projects focusing on natural regeneration. Through expanded and diversified markets for restoration benefits, strong public policy support and new financial instruments, private finance for restoration can be scaled for a wider variety of restoration projects in more diverse geographical contexts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Forest; Geography; Motivation; Risk; Forests; Geography; Motivation; Risk,forest; geography; motivation; risk; Forests; Geography; Motivation; Risk,"We thank the 30 anonymous interviewees who took time to make this study possible.

Specifically, it investigates whether and how BGD in banks causes higher engagement in CER. To address this research question, we analyzed a sample of 132 global banks over the 2009–2019 period. The results from fixed effect panel regressions indicated that national gender inequality negatively moderates the positive influence of BGD on the CER engagement of banks. Disentangling CER into its sub-pillars, we found that BGD affects these subdimensions differently. A higher proportion of female directors on the bank's board mainly affects CER in terms of eco-innovation and emission management. These findings are relevant for the efficiency of new banking business models, for policymakers and for the broader spillover benefits to the worldwide community. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Board Gender Diversity; Environmental Responsibility; Gender Inequality; Sdg 5; Socially Responsible Banking,,,"Aggarwal, Rajesh K., The performance of female hedge fund managers, Review of Financial Economics, 29, pp. 23-36, (2016); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, A review of studies on green finance of banks, research gaps and future directions, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 12, 4, pp. 1241-1264, (2022); Albertini, Elisabeth, Does Environmental Management Improve Financial Performance?

In addition, these relationships among the counties with different levels of income and carbon emissions were also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used the International Monetary Fund database for indicators of FI. The environmental indicators were obtained from the World Bank database for a panel of worldwide countries from 2004 to 2019. Separate indices of environmental sustainability (ES) and environmental degradation (ED) were created by using principal component analysis. The generalized method of moments regression was applied to examine the relationship between variables. Findings: The study found full mediation of IZ between FI and ES, whereas partial mediation between FI and environmental degradation. The results were found robust against alternative measures of carbon emissions. Furthermore, the study also bifurcated the sample according to the level of income and carbon emission. It was found that FI plays a positive role in the betterment of environmental quality for high-income countries, while a negative role in upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income and low-income countries. Besides, FI has a negative role in the ES of the countries having higher or lower carbon emission levels. Originality/value: Empirically this study contributes by creating two different novel measures of ES and environmental degradation, in contrast to other studies that solely relied on carbon emission. Contrary to previous studies, this study suggests that FI is not solely responsible for environmental damages, and IZ is the key channel by which FI shifts its impact on ES. Moreover, for environmental degradation, there are some other channels involved that need to be investigated further. This study has also noted that the relationship between FI and ES is context-dependent. Theoretically, this paper contributes to the literature by using ecological modernization theory in the nexus of FI, IZ and environmental quality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ecological Modernization Theory; Environmental Sustainability; Financial Inclusion; Industrialization,,,"Acheampong, Alex O., Modelling for insight: Does financial development improve environmental quality?, Energy Economics, 83, pp. 156-179, (2019); Ahamed, M.

Weather index insurance has been pointed out as a tool for increasing the financial resilience of food production. However, the multi-hazard insurance design needs to be better understood. This paper aims to review weather index insurance design for food security resilience, including the methodology for calculating natural hazards' indices, vulnerability assessment, and risk pricing. We searched for relevant research papers in the Scopus database using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. Initially, 364 peer-reviewed papers from 1 January 2010 to 19 February 2022 were screened for bibliometric analysis. Then, the 26 most relevant papers from the last 5 years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a significant research effort on index insurance, most papers focused on food production. However, research considering other aspects of food security, such as transportation, storage, and distribution, is lacking. Most research focuses on droughts. Other hazards, such as extreme temperature variation, excessive rainfall, and wildfires, were poorly covered. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards, neglecting the synergy hypothesis between hazards. Lastly, we proposed a conceptual framework that illustrates design paths for a generalized weather index insurance design and evaluation. Solutions for addressing multi-hazard problems are considered. An illustrative example demonstrates the importance of testing the multi-hazard risk hypothesis for weather-based index insurance design for soybean production in Brazil. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Food Security; Hazard Management; Natural Hazard; Price Dynamics; Vulnerability; Weather,food security; hazard management; natural hazard; price dynamics; vulnerability; weather,"This study was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior do Brasil (CAPES) (finance code 001, grant no. 88888.057913/2013-00) and regular funding to the post-graduate program in Hydraulics and Sanitation of the São Carlos School of Engineering of the University of Sao Paulo by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).

Though the developed construction industries have already made efforts to switching to more sustainable and environment friendly practices, the developing countries are still lacking it. This research was organised to understand the role of project management practises and integrated methods in the sustainable development in the developing countries, for looking on how such practices can help these construction sectors become sustainable. The moderation effect of industrial attitudes and behaviours on sustainable construction was also conducted to understand the intermediary impacts. A survey based on the snowball sample of 208 construction professionals in Ghana was conducted to determine the impact of project management practises and integrated methods on sustainable construction. Research model was tested by employing bivariate correlation and multiple hierarchical regression analysis techniques, to establish the interrelationships among the project management practices, integrated approaches, industrial attitudes and behaviours, and sustainable construction and to explain these constructs in terms of their common underlying dimensions. The findings highlight that the project management practices and integrated approaches are significantly impacting on the sustainable construction practices in terms of BIM, Digital Twin, LEED, and BREEAM. Whereas the industrial attitudes and behaviours were found to be affecting the project management practises and integrated approaches through moderating role on sustainable construction. The study was concluded by suggesting the importance of sustainable construction practices and shaping industrial attitudes and behaviours towards such practices in the developing construction industries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Industrial Attitudes And Behaviours; Integrated Approaches; Moderation Effect; Project Management Practices; Sustainable Construction; Construction Industry; Developing World; Integrated Approach; Management Practice; Project Management; Ghana,construction industry; developing world; integrated approach; management practice; project management; Ghana,"This research is funded by Researchers Supporting Project number (RSP‐2021/280), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Abd Jamil, Ahmad Huzaimi, The Integration of Lean Construction and Sustainable Construction: A Stakeholder Perspective in Analyzing Sustainable Lean Construction Strategies in Malaysia, Procedia Computer Science, 100, pp. 634-643, (2016); Abidin, Nazirah Zainul, Soft cost elements: Exploring management components of project costs in green building projects, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 87, (2021); Abou-Warda, Sherein H., Mediation effect of sustainability competencies on the relation between barriers and project sustainability (the case of Egyptian higher education enhancement projects), Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 5, 1, pp. 68-94, (2014); Scoping Study on the Evolution of Industry in Ghana, (2014); Aghimien, Douglas Omoregie, Microscoping the challenges of sustainable construction in developing countries, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 17, 6, pp. 1110-1128, (2019); Agyekum, Kofi, Obstacles to green building project financing: an empirical study in Ghana, International Journal of Construction Management, 22, 15, pp. 2922-2930, (2022); How can the Construction Industry in Ghana Become Sustainable Master S Degree Thesis School of Engineering Blekinge Institute of Technology Karlskrona Sweden, (2014); Ahmed, Salma, The challenges of sustainable construction projects delivery–evidence from the UAE, Architectural Engineering and Design Management, 18, 3, pp. 299-312, (2022); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alam, Morshed, Government championed strategies to overcome the barriers to public building energy efficiency retrofit projects, Sustainable Cities and Society, 44, pp. 56-69, (2019)",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,10991719; 09680802,0415282101; 9780203495933,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141385879,

Using a sample of 244 commercial banks across 52 countries from 2002 to 2020, we provide evidence that during the global health crisis, banks with higher levels of ES activities are more financially stable (i.e. lower credit and liquidity risk exposures). Drawing on social capital and stakeholder theories, we find that ES activities increase firm-level social capital and establish a stakeholder-centred culture within a bank, strengthening social trust and public confidence in the bank's risk oversight. Accordingly, ES activities constrain excessive and aggressive bank risk-taking during turbulent times when short-termism prevails. Our additional analysis reveals that investors value such beneficial effects of ES activities. The findings offer new insights into the increasingly significant roles of social capital creation and stakeholder-centred culture in maintaining banks’ financial stability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,We would like to express our gratitude to Editors and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this paper.

This study also connects change management with sustainability transformation and addresses future research in this nexus. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business Organizations; Change Management; Environmental Social And Governance (esg) Factors; Sustainability Transformation; Business Organizations; Change Management; Change Modeling; Environmental Social And Governance Factor; Evidence-based; G Factors; Organizational Change; Sustainability Transformation; Transformation Modeling; Transformation Process; Sustainable Development; Business; Governance Approach; Management Practice; Organizational Change; Sustainability; Aptitude; Change Management; Commercial Phenomena; Cultural Anthropology; Empowerment; Environmental Factor; Evidence Based Practice; Government; Human; Knowledge; Management; Organization; Program Sustainability; Reinforcement (psychology); Review; Risk; Social Aspect; Change Management; Organizations,Business organizations; Change management; Change modeling; Environmental social and governance factor; Evidence-based; G factors; Organizational change; Sustainability transformation; Transformation modeling; Transformation process; Sustainable development; business; governance approach; management practice; organizational change; sustainability; aptitude; change management; commercial phenomena; cultural anthropology; empowerment; environmental factor; evidence based practice; government; human; knowledge; management; organization; program sustainability; reinforcement (psychology); Review; risk; social aspect; Change Management; Organizations,,"Abson, David James, Leverage points for sustainability transformation, Ambio, 46, 1, pp. 30-39, (2017); Journal of Sustainability Management, (2014); Harvard Business Review, (1990); Benn, Suzanne, Organizational Change for Corporate Sustainability: Fourth Edition, pp. 1-342, (2018); Berg, Florian, Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings*, Review of Finance, 26, 6, pp. 1315-1344, (2022); Embedding Sustainability in Organizational Culture A Systematic Review of the Body of Knowledge, (2010); Bies, Robert J., The Delivery of Bad News in Organizations: A Framework for Analysis, Journal of Management, 39, 1, pp. 136-162, (2013); How do I Implement Complex Change at Scale, (2011); Gholamzadeh Chofreh, Abdoulmohammad Gholamzadeh, Review of Frameworks for Sustainability Implementation, Sustainable Development, 25, 3, pp. 180-188, (2017); Research in Organizational Change and Development, (1987)",,Academic Press,,03014797; 10958630,,JEVMA,36621319.0,English,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145867662,

Its goal is to channel funding toward sustainable blue economy projects related to the ocean and freshwater. While the protection of hydric resources has gained importance within the problem of climate change, Sustainable Development Goals linked to water remain the most underfunded. Since the issuance of the first blue bond in the Seychelles in 2018, multiple public and private organizations have turned to the blue bond market to raise funds. However, unlike the green bond market, no comprehensive market overview exists, preventing stakeholders from judging whether this label has been effective in protecting water resources and drawing conclusions on its future potential. This paper draws on an extensive review of academic research and complements it with a unique and comprehensive analysis of blue bonds issued to date, providing a contribution to the literature on sustainable finance. Between 2018 and 2022, 26 blue bond transactions took place, amounting to a total value of USD 5.0 billion, with a 92% CAGR between those years. Currently, blue bonds represent less than 0.5% of the sustainable debt market. The use of proceeds has mostly focused on waste management, biodiversity, and sustainable fisheries, but also ranges across other areas of the sustainable blue economy. Only two-thirds of blue bond issuers report on impact metrics, providing further opportunity to add detail and rigor. We draw comparisons to the more mature green bond market and conclude that a lack of standardized definitions, metrics, and expertise by issuers and investors are significant barriers to the blue bond market. Resolving these barriers is crucial to attract corporations and ensure continued growth of the blue bond market. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blue Bonds; Blue Economy; Blue Finance; Esg; Green Bonds; Sustainable Finance; Sustainable Investing,,,"International Journal of Research in Business and Social Science 21474478, (2021); Adb Issues First Blue Bond for Ocean Investments, (2021); Green and Blue Bond Framework, (2021); Investor Presentationinvesting in A Prosperous Inclusive Resilient and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific, (2022); Ocean Finance Framework, (2022); First Blue Funding Supported by Ifc Supports the Sustainable Use of Water in Romania 100 Million for Banca Transilvania, (2022); Resolution no Scvs Irq Drmv 2022 00007936, (2022); Banga, Josué, The green bond market: a potential source of climate finance for developing countries, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 9, 1, pp. 17-32, (2019); Bbva Assisted Desarrollos Hidraulicos De Cancun in the Issuance of the First Blue Bond in Mexico and the First of Its Kind for the Bank, (2023); Bdo Issues First Blue Bond for US 100 Million, (2022)",,MDPI,,19118074,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150862570,

According to the European Union Council, sport and physical activity play a strategic role in the global challenge toward sustainability and achieving the 17 SDGs. The contribution of sport to the 2030 Agenda is indeed strategic. However, through a non-systematic review, the authors have observed almost a complete absence of SDGs within sports literature. Discussing the results through the lens of the SDGs, the authors have identified a series of qualitative and quantitative research opportunities connected with the 17 SDGs and related targets. The authors have also identified a total of 27 research hypotheses.

The result of these events is the acceleration of the implementation of a new model of socioeconomic development of societies referred to as the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) model. It has been particularly evident in the financial investment sector. Analyses of the relative performance of ESG funds is inconclusive due to the lack of a clear definition of responsible investments, and insufficient quality of the available data and ESG ratings. However, most of the studies find a positive correlation between ESG factors and company's financial performance. The analyses showed that these positive results are more pronounced over the longer term and impact the stock prices of those companies. ESG funds offer better downside protection during crises in relation to traditional funds. Despite the lack of legal barriers, the Polish economy has experienced very long delays in implementing the ESG model and the gap is even more pronounced in the financial industry. This is surprising as Poland is a very interesting market for sustainable investment given its current underdevelopment and overall potential related to green transformation. In Poland, only 17 investment funds deeply integrate ESG criteria. Educational and communication barriers have been identified as the main obstacles to the development of the sustainable finance market in Poland.

The changing society has recognized the need for more sustainable ecological balance so that the coming generations can survive in a better environment. Keeping this in view, the business are also focusing on environmental sustainability and striving for eco-friendly production methods and techniques .Banking sector being an integral part of Indian economy providing services to businesses and the individuals is also taking a major step to change its banking practices to adopt environmental sustainability practices by adopting green banking strategies and pave way for green financing .The aim of Green banking is to implement environmentally friendly practices in offering banking services through promotion of digital transactions thereby reducing carbon footprints in its operations. Hence, environmental concern which is gaining prominence has become the core crux for the banks to adopt green banking strategies to make contributions for green economy. The study attempted to addresses the latest sustainability developments in Indian banks by appropriate green banking practices and strategies and the challenges they face during implementation. The analysis is purely based on the secondary data source. In conclusion, the study also stresses upon the significance of awareness among clients and customers, the core values that the green banks deliver to develop green image as a part of environmental responsibility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Digital Transactions; Environmental Responsibility; Green Banking; Green Financing; Sustainable Development,,"Solar ATM: ATMs are now a crucial component of the payment system. In remote isolated places with little electricity, ATM problems are fairly common. The issue of ATM inoperation brought on by power interruptions can be resolved with solar ATMs. Approximately 250 crores was funded by NABARD to Commercial and regional rural banks to provide around 5000 ATMS throughout the country. 2.5 million rural residents who lack access to electricity and the internet will profit from this. Solar ATMs use less than 100 watts of power and can operate effectively up to 50 degrees. Conventional ATMs use 500 to 600 watts of power and may stop working at temperatures above 35 degrees. Additionally, the cost of solar-powered ATMs is 30% less than the cost of a traditional ATM, and its operational cost is also considerably reduced. Green Bonds: The main distinction between a green bond and a regular bond is that money is being raised to support ""green"" projects. This is a novel method of funding renewable energy initiatives. India's first green bonds denominated in dollars were issued by EXIM Bank. 500 million dollars of green bonds were issued by the bank in March 2017 to finance projects with environmental concerns in countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. 100 billion rupees were also raised by Yes Bank through 10-year bonds. An analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance named Shantanu Jaiswal claims that green bonds frequently have lower interest rates than loans provided by traditional banks. Consequently, green bonds provide independent power producers with better yields than conventional types of debt.","Canadian Journal of Business and Information Studies, (2020); Nuryakin, Nuryakin, Green product competitiveness and green product success.

This article is premised on the outlook for the first GB in Ghana. The study investigates the features of GBs, which investors prioritize as preferential for RE financing (REF). Employing the literature, twelve beneficial features of GBs were identified and formed the based for a questionnaire, which was handed to experts in financial institutions to complete. Data were analysed and ranked with the relative importance index and other statistical tests. The findings illustrated that low-interest rates, similar payback period, economic convenience and transparency issuance are among the top preferential features for feasible GB rollouts in Ghana. Findings implied that akin to other worldwide cases for REF, GBs represent a degree of flexibility, which stems from the homogeneity in their respective features. The study illustrates the specific priorities, which must be considered by potential investors. Resultantly, enabling GBs issuers to develop GB packages that suit the needs of the investment community and ultimately contribute to RE targets' achievement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Financing; Ghana; Green Bonds (gbs); Green Bonds (gbs) Features; Renewable Energy (re); Developing Countries; Energy Policy; Renewable Energy Resources; Europe; Financing; Ghana; Green Bond; Green Bond Feature; Green Products; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy; Renewable Energy Projects; Renewable Energy Source; Investments,Developing countries; Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; Europe; Financing; Ghana; Green bond; Green bond feature; Green products; Renewable energies; Renewable energy; Renewable energy projects; Renewable energy source; Investments,,"Understanding the African Green Bond Market, (2018); Smart Sustain Built Environ, (2020); Agliardi, Elettra, Financing environmentally-sustainable projects with green bonds, Environment and Development Economics, 24, 6, pp. 608-623, (2019); Alteneiji, Khalifa, Critical success factors for public–private partnerships in affordable housing in the United Arab Emirates, International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis, 13, 5, pp. 753-768, (2020); undefined; Aninze, Festus, The role of microfinance to empower women: The case of developing countries, International Journal of Customer Relationship Marketing and Management, 9, 1, pp. 54-78, (2018); Asiedu, Nana Yaw, Energy economics and optimal generation mix of selected power plants technologies in Ghana, Scientific African, 2, (2019); Representative Offices their Registered Offices in Ghana, (2019); Berson, Susan A., Finance: Green grows the portfolio, ABA Journal, 95, NOV., pp. 25-26, (2009); Natural Resources and Environment, (2017)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,15580040; 00189391,,IEEMA,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112472991,

Higher costs and limited availability of water affect the profitability and liquidity of companies. The Water Credit Risk tool developed by the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), Natural Capital Declaration (NCD), and German Association for Environmental Management and Sustainability in Financial Institutions (VfU) assesses the shadow price of water (SPW) as the potential future cost of water and models its impact on a company's income and cash flow. Examining the SPW and its implications for operational and capital expenses provides indications of the companies' vulnerability to water risk. The effects on financial ratios highlight the need for companies to develop mitigation strategies, and they alert financial investors about opportunities and threats associated with water-related investments. The chapter addresses the SPW-related sensitivity of three selected companies from various industries with respect to changes in their operational structure across time, changes in the SPW between two different points in time, and projections of the SPW into the future. Depending on the company-specific calculation of the SPW and the firms' business model, the results provide individual sensitivities to water challenges as well as individual potentials to respond. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Credit Risk Tool; Shadow Price Water; Water Risk; Water Sensitivity,,,"Bierkens, Marc F.P., The Shadow Price of Irrigation Water in Major Groundwater-Depleting Countries, Water Resources Research, 55, 5, pp. 4266-4287, (2019); Water Risk Valuation Tool, (2015); Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon Climate Change and Financial Stability, (2015); Value of Water, (2018); Climate Risk and Decarbonization What Every Mining Ceo Needs to Know, (2020); Integrated Report 2013 2014, (2014); Integrated Report 2020 2021, (2021); Annual Report Great Challenges, (2013); 2020 Annual Report, (2020); Financial Statements 2020, (2020)",,Springer International Publishing,,,9.78303E+12,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160643204,

Despite efforts to maximize social benefits from climate, development, and conservation, externally driven processes can converge to amplify vulnerabilities and inequalities. Pre-existing social injustices increase the sensitivity of affected individuals to change and limit their capacity to adapt or benefit from the interacting impacts of triple exposure. We argue that external implementors cannot effectively and equitably achieve climate, economic, and conservation goals without prioritizing social justice and building general resilience. We therefore recommend that implementors: (1) address root causes of vulnerability, namely pre-existing social injustices; (2) use participatory systems approaches to improve understanding of local contexts and potential consequences of proposed initiatives; and (3) leverage inclusive partnerships to facilitate collaborative design and implementation. These strategies—applied together and adapted to local contexts—can support well-being, justice, and resilience within coastal communities experiencing rapid change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blue Economy; Blue Growth; Climate Change; Conservation; Equity; Justice; Social-ecological System; Sustainability; Transformation; Vulnerability; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Coastal Zone; Conservation Management; Social Justice; Sustainability; Vulnerability,climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; conservation management; social justice; sustainability; vulnerability,"We would like to thank the Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP), for facilitating a convening space for many of the authors to discuss this work, and the members of the Coastal Outcomes Working Group for their ideas that helped shape this article.

It also investigates the moderating role of government quality on the association between environmental change and inclusive finance. We collected five-year average data from various sources such as the World Development Indicators, the World Governance Indicators, and the International Monetary Fund. Government quality is measured by six dimensions: political stability, voice and accountability, government effectiveness, regulation quality, the rule of law, and corruption control. Environmental change is measured by CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Inclusive finance is measured by the financial development index through depth, access, and efficiency ratios. These variables represent the most used in prior studies as they are published by international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which represent a reputable source of timely information related to the business environment in which business executives operate in several countries. The results show a significant impact of environmental change on inclusive finance. Including economic governance induces a significant and positive effect on financial inclusion in all instances. Our results also show that the coefficients of the interaction between environmental change and governance dimensions are positive and significant. The moderator role of governance is improved when taking into account political, institutional, and economic governance. Our findings offer more motivation for regulators and governments to develop environmental policies that integrate inclusive finance to meet sustainable development goals. Our results are important as they can help regulators, investors, and policymakers to assess and better understand the potential moderation role of governance quality in the relationship between inclusive finance and environmental change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Change; Government Quality; Inclusive Finance; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals; Banking; Business; Environmental Change; Finance; Service Quality; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal,banking; business; environmental change; finance; service quality; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal,"Funding text 1: All authors acknowledge funding support given by Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2023R260), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Funding text 2: Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2023R260), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Hasan, Morshadul Morshadul, Promoting China’s Inclusive Finance Through Digital Financial Services, Global Business Review, 23, 4, pp. 984-1006, (2022); International Funding for Financial Inclusion World Bank Other Operational Studies, (2017); Alaimo, Leonardo S., Measuring Sustainable Development by Non-aggregative Approach, Social Indicators Research, 157, 1, pp. 101-122, (2021); Alsulami, Alanoud, Flexible Working Arrangements and Social Sustainability: Study on Women Academics Post-COVID-19, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 1, (2023); Le, Thai Ha, Financial inclusion and its impact on financial efficiency and sustainability: Empirical evidence from Asia, Borsa Istanbul Review, 19, 4, pp. 310-322, (2019); Simplice, Asongu Anutechia, Governance, CO2 emissions and inclusive human development in sub-Saharan Africa, Energy Exploration and Exploitation, 38, 1, pp. 18-36, (2020); Financial Inclusion and Poverty Reduction Evidence from Small Scale Agricultural Sector in Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe, (2020); Chirambo, Dumisani, Enhancing Climate Change Resilience Through Microfinance: Redefining the Climate Finance Paradigm to Promote Inclusive Growth in Africa, Journal of Developing Societies, 33, 1, pp. 150-173, (2017); Borgi, Hela, Compliance level with IFRS disclosure requirements across 12 African countries: do enforcement mechanisms matter?, Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance, 30, 1, pp. 60-81, (2022); Assessing Progress in Africa Towards the Millennium Development Goals Mdg Report 2013 Food Security in Africa Issues Challenges and Lessons, (2013)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149272483,

These include increasing flood hazards and the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly recognized within strategies to provide multiple ecosystem services to mitigate existing risks and pressures, as well as to make cities more resilient and livable. Although being increasingly addressed within the literature, NBS implementation on the ground still faces many technical and financial barriers. This paper aims to test the potential of selected NBS in mitigating the effects of identified climate change risks, i.e., the UHI effect and urban floods, in the Turin urban area (north-western Italy). Four different intervention NBS-based scenarios are developed. The supply of ecosystem services by NBS in each scenario is assessed using InVEST models and the effectiveness of NBS investments is analyzed by calculating and comparing the associated costs and benefits. Different results in terms of effectiveness and economic viability are observed for each scenario and each NBS. Flood risk mitigation oriented NBS seem to have the most impact, in particular forested green areas and retention ponds. The results are relevant to suggest policy mix strategies to embed NBS in city planning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Economic Valuation; Ecosystem Services; Green Infrastructures; Nature-based Solutions (nbs); Sustainable Cities; Urban Flooding; Urban Green; Urban Heat Island (uhi) Effect; Climate Change; Cost-benefit Analysis; Ecosystem Service; Flooding; Greenspace; Infrastructural Development; Urban Area; Italy; Piedmont [italy]; Torino [piedmont]; Turin,climate change; cost-benefit analysis; ecosystem service; flooding; greenspace; infrastructural development; urban area; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin,"This research was funded by the municipality of Turin, grant number CIG 8042107CA1.","World Urbanization Prospects the 2018 Revision, (2019); Climate Change Impacts and Vulnerability in Europe 2016, (2017); Rosenzweig, Cynthia E., Preface, pp. xv-xvi, (2018); Vardoulakis, Sotiris, Grand Challenges in Sustainable Cities and Health, Frontiers in Sustainable Cities, 1, (2019); Fini, Alessio, Nature based solutions to mitigate soil sealing in urban areas: Results from a 4-year study comparing permeable, porous, and impermeable pavements, Environmental Research, 156, pp. 443-454, (2017); Scalenghe, Riccardo, The anthropogenic sealing of soils in urban areas, Landscape and Urban Planning, 90, 1-2, pp. 1-10, (2009); Liu, Jie, Meta-analysis of urbanization impact on rainfall modification, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Parker, Jackie, Nature-based solutions forming urban intervention approaches to anthropogenic climate change: A quantitative literature review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 18, (2020); Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten, Impacts of climate change on rainfall extremes and urban drainage systems: A review, Water Science and Technology, 68, 1, pp. 16-28, (2013); Costa, Sandra, Effectiveness of nature-based solutions on pluvial flood hazard mitigation: The case study of the city of eindhoven (the netherlands), Resources, 10, 3, (2021)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,2073445X,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149152754,

This is commonly referred to as the “infrastructure finance gap”. To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-to-end example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; Decentralized Oracle Network; Performance-based Finance; Sustainable Infrastructure; Benchmarking; Climate Change; Decision Making; Investments; Storms; Asset Class; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized Oracle Network; Financing Mechanisms; Literature Reviews; Modeling Approach; Performance Based; Performance-based Finance; Sustainable Infrastructure; Blockchain; Finance; Information And Communication Technology; Infrastructure; Network Analysis; Sustainability,Benchmarking; Climate change; Decision making; Investments; Storms; Asset class; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized oracle network; Financing mechanisms; Literature reviews; Modeling approach; Performance based; Performance-based finance; Sustainable infrastructure; Blockchain; finance; information and communication technology; infrastructure; network analysis; sustainability,The authors thank Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) for funding KC's research through a gift to the Center for Digital Asset Finance at the University of Michigan.

However, whether this constitutes merely the updating of the language of sustainable development or a new discourse of environmental and development governance is unclear. Resilience is often characterised as a form of neoliberal governmentality that seeks to individualise the mitigation of ecological risks, implying that it is simply an extension of neoliberal sustainable development. However, this elides other possible articulations of resilience within environmental and development governance discourse more broadly. By developing and applying an innovative discourse analysis method, this article clarifies the relationship between sustainable development and resilience across these wider fields. We find that resilience is also articulated as a response to the failure of neoliberal sustainable development; as an integrating discourse of climate security and sustainable development; as a prerequisite for sustainable development; and as qualitatively different to sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Security; Discourse Analysis; Environmental Policy And Governance; Neoliberalism; Resilience; Sustainable Development; Environmental Policy; Governance Approach; Neoliberalism; Policy Development; Qualitative Analysis; Sustainable Development,environmental policy; governance approach; neoliberalism; policy development; qualitative analysis; sustainable development,"Some of the preliminary findings of this paper were briefly sketched in Ferguson et al.

For instance, fossil fuel extraction may be significantly scaled-back, and coal-power plants may be idled or even phased out prematurely, thus becoming stranded assets for the shareholders. Using a global general equilibrium model with detailed energy sector and capital stock structures, we estimate the corresponding stranded assets under various emissions mitigation scenarios. Our findings reveal that, depending on the policy scenario, the global net present value of unrealized fossil fuel output through 2050 relative to a ""no policy""scenario is between 21.5 and 30.6 trillion USD, and that of stranded assets in coal power generation is between 1.3 and 2.3 trillion USD. The analytical framework presented in our study complements existing research, in which macroeconomic variables required for estimating the stranded assets are often derived from models with more simplified assumptions. Therefore, individual firms and financial institutions can combine our economy-wide analysis with details on their own investment portfolios to determine their climate-related transition risk exposure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Policies; Economy-wide Analysis; Stranded Assets,,,"Aguiar, Angel H., An overview of the GTAP 9 data base, Journal of Global Economic Analysis, 1, 1, pp. 181-208, (2016); Stranded Assets and the Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign What does Divestment Mean for the Valuation of Fossil Fuel Assets, (2013); Life Insurance Stress Test 2019 Scenario Specification Guidelines and Instructions, (2019); Will Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Policies Abroad Affect the Domestic Economy the Case of Taiwan Climate, (2019); Hecht, Melanie, BORDER ADJUSTMENTS SUPPLEMENTING A CAP and TRADE SYSTEM to COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, Climate Change Economics, 10, 4, (2019); Chen, Yen Heng Henry, Long-term economic modeling for climate change assessment, Economic Modelling, 52, pp. 867-883, (2016); Uncertainty Analysis of the Cost of Climate Policies, (2004); DeAngelo, Julianne, Energy systems in scenarios at net-zero CO2 emissions, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook, (2013); Global Energy Review 2021, (2021)",,World Scientific,,20100086; 20100078,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135471978,

The study is significant in the context of massive changes in regulations, government policy, social attitudes and market development attributed to banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The source of data for this study was ESG database of Thomson Reuters. The study was based on 472 global banks. The research paper uses two-stage least square model and the study covered the five-year period 2015–2019. Findings: Banks with high intensity of social and governance-related activities have positive market-based valuation effects. Adequately capitalized banks tend to invest more in social initiatives. Banks' governance initiatives directed toward the use of anti-takeover defensive mechanisms are skeptically perceived by markets. Riskier banks tend to have less investments in social initiatives. Research limitations/implications: The findings are relevant in the context of expectations from policymakers, consumers and investors with respect to the role which banks ought to play in funding the development of a sustainable economy. The research finding that strong governance and social initiatives by banks are value-enhancing measures is a clear evidence of the significance of ESG initiatives as value-creating mechanisms as perceived by markets. Originality/value: This study addresses the gap in the research, which examines the role of governance and social initiatives on value creation in the banking sector firms. The study examines the impact of different elements of governance and social initiatives on financial performance of banks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking Performance; Governance Initiatives; Social Initiatives; Sustainability; Value Creation,,The authors thank the reviewers for the valuable suggestions to improve the paper.,"Alareeni, Bahaaeddin Ahmed, ESG impact on performance of US S&P 500-listed firms, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 20, 7, pp. 1409-1428, (2020); Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); Jan, Amin, The nexus of sustainability practices and financial performance: From the perspective of Islamic banking, Journal of Cleaner Production, 228, pp. 703-717, (2019); Buallay, Amina Mohammed, Sustainability reporting and firm’s performance: Comparative study between manufacturing and banking sectors, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 69, 3, pp. 431-445, (2020); Amini, Mehdi, Corporate sustainability: An integrative definition and framework to evaluate corporate practice and guide academic research, Journal of Cleaner Production, 76, pp. 12-19, (2014); Aras, Güler, Causality and interaction: Sustainable markets and sustainable business, pp. 15-40, (2016); Artiach, Tracy C., The determinants of corporate sustainability performance, Accounting and Finance, 50, 1, pp. 31-51, (2010); Beck, Thorsten, Financial institutions and markets across countries and over time: The updated financial development and structure database, World Bank Economic Review, 24, 1, pp. 77-92, (2010); Buallay, Amina Mohammed, Is sustainability reporting (ESG) associated with performance?

This article explores the evolution of the soft-law environment in which the code operates and reaches the conclusion that the revision was both timely and necessary. A comparison between CRISA 2 and recent trends in investor stewardship codes and regulation shows that CRISA 2 has kept pace in some respects but still lags in others. The move to ’apply and explain’ falls in line with King IV and the approach of the UK Stewardship Code 2020. The extension of its application to all investment types rather than solely shares is an improvement. The code retains its focus on responsible investment — an aspect only recently adopted internationally in comparative codes — but has opted not to shift to sustainability language despite contemplating this approach in the draft. This may have been a missed opportunity. Aspects that could improve include considering engagement outside of voting; more express duties for service providers, including proxy advisors; the need to ascertain client and beneficiary needs; and more accessible language. Annual reporting and oversight remain with an industry body, which makes greater reporting doubtful. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Investor Stewardship; Responsible Investment; Soft Law,,,"Modern Law Review, (1996); Australian Journal of Legal Philosophy, (2002); Giamporcaro, Stéphanie, SRI in South Africa: A melting-pot of local and global influences, Critical Studies on Corporate Responsibility, Governance and Sustainability, 7, pp. 215-246, (2014); Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century South Africa Roadmap, (2017); Company and Securities Lj, (2020); Migliorelli, Marco, What do we mean by sustainable finance?

Knowledge of impacts and damages of natural and climatic disasters, besides the development of related insurance products, are among the factors that play a significant role in a better understanding of climatic threats and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Therefore, this research was carried out in order to examine the status of Iran’s insurance industry in understanding the effects of climate change and developing related insurance products. Materials & Methods: The research method for this paper is applied research that consists of documentary studies and mixed exploratory studies in terms of the research strategy. In order to examine the international experiences of the world insurance industry in the field of climate change, library studies were used, and to examine the current situation of the Iranian insurance industry in understanding the phenomenon of climate change and insurance products, a questionnaire was used. Findings: Evidence of climate change and insurance products used in selected developed and developing countries were first studied, and then the questionnaire results were analyzed. Findings show the deep and extensive attention of the insurance industry to the phenomenon of climate change, the need for requirements such as providing detailed statistical analyzes of the number of damages and effects caused by the occurrence of climate change, clarifying the harmful effects of climate change on profitability, considering environmental issues and biological changes in the macro policies of the country, creating fundamental thinking and attitude regarding climate change in the country. So far, a comprehensive analysis of Iran’s insurance industry’s understanding of climate change and the use of various insurance products has yet to be done. This research was done to solve this research gap so that its results will be a guide for the insurance industry managers. Conclusion: The results indicate that some insurance companies in Iran have accepted the climate change phenomena by observing the intuitive effects of climate change and its impact on the company’s activities. In addition, climate change has increased customer demand for some insurance products, and the consequences of climate change have caused the need to develop and upgrade the products and use new insurance products. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Risks; Insurance Companies; International Experiences; Risk Management,,,"Ecopersia, (2019); Climate Adapt, (2016); Cred, (2022); Naic, (2008); Adoption of the Paris Agreement, (2016); Issues Paper on Climate Change Risks to the Insurance Sector, (2018); Risks and Solutions of the Insurance Industry in the Face of Climate Change, (2019); Investigating the Impacts of Climate Change on the Occurrence of Droughts from the Past to the Future in the World and Iran with an Emphasis on Drought Risk Zoning with the Insurance Industry Approach, (2019); Mckinsey Company Our Insights, (2020); CEA, (2009)",,Tarbiat Modares University,,23222700; 25382152,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206848749,

Investors are actively increasing their investments in companies that support sustainable development strategies, as changes related to ESG principles are taking place around the world and are seen by most participants as a promising opportunity for development and revenue generation. The current challenge facing society and business is to study the ESG agenda, implement it into operations and develop appropriate recommendations to promote ESG principles to improve the environment and well-being of the global community. In order to address inequality and stimulate economic growth, the UN adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015 and launched a plan to ensure sustainability for present and future generations, reduce poverty and improve the lives of people around the world. Governments and business communities in various countries are realizing the adverse impacts of climate change, which affects the well-being and economic status of the nation, and building a more sustainable global economy contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

In this paper, we study how the market for green insurance has evolved and discuss the current challenges. The important elements promoting sustainable growth in the market include universal consensus on the definition of green insurance, an optimal regulatory framework, technological advancement, and talent nurturing, and rising social acceptance. We apply the institutional framework to explore the future direction of market reform for a sustainable market. Reinforcing the three institutional pillars will help to address the current deficiencies in the market. The pollution liability market in China is examined as a case study.

First, healthcare service providers could enhance ESG awareness based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Second, companies in the healthcare industry are highly encouraged to impose systematic ESG management in their business operations within the industry. Third-party ESG ratings, independent assurance on sustainability reporting, and ESG certification are three common methods. Third, accounting and finance professionals are vital in offering expert advice on ESG integration and evaluating ESG performance. In particular, biodiversity accounting and carbon accounting are the two emerging ESG topics in accounting practice, while ESG financial products and financial technology in business sustainability practice are two growing issues in the field. Finally, it is vital to create ESG awareness in the local community.

It analyzes the management challenges associated with international cooperation rather than the more commonly explored political or economic lenses. This text is structured to enable students to connect theory with practice, beginning with the main management frameworks developed in the context of corporate and national public/nonprofit organizations and adapting them to the specificity of international institutions and international non-governmental organizations. This leads to the identification of a “tailored” approach to international organization management based on their institutional and operational settings, stakeholder groups, core business, staff profiles, and financial arrangements. The authors then connect this theory with practice by linking frameworks to several case studies and best practices of organizations currently experimenting with management systems and tools, with case studies including the World Bank and the Gates Foundation. This edition has been extensively revised and updated, with an expanded conceptual framework inclusive of systemic theories of organization, new cases throughout, and new chapters on leadership, supply chain and operations, and human-centered digitization.

However, dominant understandings in comparative law and regulatory theory about how norms, rules, and formal institutions move across borders are increasingly inadequate in the face of modern transnational policy challenges. Solving transnational problems requires regulatory innovation, complex coordination, and even competition among private and public actors in multiple jurisdictions, as well as much faster policy responses than most countries can achieve either domestically or multilaterally. Accelerating solutions to emerging transnational problems therefore demands a new focus within comparative law on how transnational legal innovation works and how to leverage its benefits faster on both a global and local scale. This Article proposes a conceptual framework to ground this effort—a “network innovation” model of transnational law formation. Building on earlier literatures on legal transplant, policy diffusion, institutional change, and transnational legal ordering, as well as studies of firm-level innovation, this approach recognizes that new norms, rules, and other institutions are sourced from, coordinated by, and transmitted through transnational networks of public and private actors. Moving beyond prior literatures, however, it views transnational law formation as an aggregating process of innovation where the resulting outputs are the complex product of multiple experimental sites and sources. This approach offers a more accurate descriptive account of transnational regulatory change and points to network innovation processes as central to solving common or collective transnational problems. This Article illustrates the proposed framework with case studies of efforts to build sustainable financial systems. It concludes by suggesting strategies to accelerate network innovation and considering how this theoretical paradigm might inform new directions in comparative law. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Oxford Handbook of Comparative Law, (2008); undefined, (2018); undefined; Infra Part I Ab Surveying the Legal Transplant and Policy Diffusion Literatures; See Infra Part I C D; undefined; undefined, (1956); This Definition is Adapted from Rogerss Classic Study of Innovation Diffusion Everett M Rogers Diffusion of Innovations, (2003); Initiative Unep Fi Roadmap for A Sustainable Financial System, (2017); British Journal of Political Science, (2014)",,Oxford University Press,,0002919X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189468472,

Analyzing annual reports and publications, the research evaluates ESG initiatives of three banks: HSBC Bahrain, Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Bahrain, and the National Bank of Bahrain (NBB), and assesses the effectiveness and alignment of these practices with global sustainability goals. The literature review highlights the growing importance of integrating environmental, social, and governance considerations in banking operations. Existing research demonstrates the role of banks in promoting sustainability and aligning strategies with environmental and societal goals. With the help of a secondary research approach, the study synthesizes data from diverse sources. Results reveal distinct green initiatives of each bank. HSBC Bahrain focuses on net-zero emissions, social inclusion, and sustainable finance. SCB Bahrain emphasizes sustainable financial products, technology for ESG risk management, and stakeholder engagement. NBB Bahrain's approach includes board oversight, a sustainability committee, workforce awareness, and alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals. The conclusions of this study point towards the commitment of these banks to sustainability. Recommendations include further collaboration, enhanced reporting, innovation, community engagement, and continuous improvement in ESG strategies.

Bringing together contributions from a range of experts in the field, Climate Change Adaptation and Green Finance assesses the costs of inaction versus the costs of action based on case study examples of climate finance and sustainable investment in the Arctic region. The authors draw on data from the Sixth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and respond with a solutions-based framework. This is developed around the notion of a new, carbon-neutral economy in the Arctic and presents methods for unlocking carbon finance and long-term climate investment in the region, such as finance for Arctic entrepreneurs and resilient sustainable investment structures. This volume also looks at the role of finance in meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the ways in which innovation in investment will help shape the future of the Arctic.

Current approaches are not working fast enough. This paper, and this journal issue, conceive of the challenge as one of non-marginal structural and institutional change. Several different conceptual frameworks and pluralist theories are considered, emanating from complexity theory, economics, natural sciences, political economy, and strategy. These are deployed to identify potential accelerators, including synergies between climate action and other key political issues, and beneficial non-linear dynamics such as shifts in consumer preferences and technology learning curves. The delays in action also mean that removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is now necessary, and even unconventional geoengineering approaches may need to be considered. A pluralist and practical approach to climate action, accounting for different institutional and social contexts across countries, is argued to be required to accelerate action. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Policy; Multi-faceted Measures; Prices; Trajectory; Urgency; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Complexity; Conceptual Framework; Consumption Behavior; Environmental Economics; Institutional Framework; Policy Approach; Policy Development; Political Economy; Preference Behavior,carbon dioxide; climate change; complexity; conceptual framework; consumption behavior; environmental economics; institutional framework; policy approach; policy development; political economy; preference behavior,"The authors thank Sam Loni for research assistance.

Therefore, for many organisations, assessing the potential impact of climate risk remains a challenge. This piece of research is geared towards selecting the best artificial intelligence technique for modelling and forecasting the operational costs related to climate transition risk, such as direct or indirect utility consumption, including the costs of electricity and fossil fuels. These costs can be affected, especially by regulatory and market risks that are part of transition risk. We train 17 deep learning and machine learning models to forecast electricity and diesel consumption indicators, as well as the corresponding prices of these variables. Our results show an average prediction accuracy of 90.36% and emphasise the importance of using such decision support tools to analyse the financial impacts of climate risks within organisations. This calls for organisations to improve data collection and availability, as performing this kind of analysis is promising but currently remains a challenge due to the scarcity of available information. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Climate Risk; Climate Transition Risk; Deep Learning; Forecast; Machine Learning; Climate Change; Commerce; Costs; Decision Support Systems; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Learning Systems; Risk Assessment; Climate Risk; Climate Transition; Climate Transition Risk; Financial Impacts; Forecast; Machine-learning; Market Risks; Regulatory Risks; Risk Variables; Fossil Fuels,Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Climate risk; Climate transition; Climate transition risk; Financial impacts; Forecast; Machine-learning; Market risks; Regulatory risks; Risk variables; Fossil fuels,,"Travis, William Riebsame, What is climate risk management?, Climate Risk Management, 1, pp. 1-4, (2014); Banking and Finance, (2020); Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, (2020); Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, (2017); Monasterolo, Irene, Uncertainty of climate policies and implications for economics and finance: An evolutionary economics approach, Ecological Economics, 163, pp. 177-182, (2019); Ecb Report on Good Practices for Climate Stress Testing, (2022); Blackrock, (2020); Demand Induced Transition Risks A Systemic Approach Applied to South Africa, (2020); Eba Report on Management and Supervision of Esg Risks for Credit Institutions and Investment Firms, (2021); Carbon Beta A Market Based Measure of Climate Risk, (2022)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,9.79835E+12,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178510912,

Using a sample of announcements of bank loans issued by Chinese listed banks and an event study methodology, this study examines how the market values the green credit performance of banks. We find that banks with superior green credit performance have significantly higher market valuation upon loan announcements. Cross-sectional analyses show that the positive effect of banks' green credit performance is more pronounced when banks are less exposed to political pressures. This positive effect is also stronger when borrowers have strong environmental and social (ES) performance, provide ES disclosures, operate in industries that are not heavily polluting, have high institutional ownership, and are controlled by private shareholders. Finally, our path analysis shows that green credit increases banks' market valuation by improving the prospect of future cash flows and reducing credit risk for banks. Overall, we document that green credit is a value-enhancing practice for banks in emerging markets such as China, where legal institutions and environmental regulations may not be as developed as in more advanced markets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bank Loan; China; Environmental And Social Performance; Green Credit; Market Valuation,,"Funding text 1: We thank three anonymous referees, the Editors (Wenxuan Hou and Jason Xiao), and Guest Editors (Sofia Johan and Feng Zhan) for their insightful and constructive comments that helped significantly improve this paper.

This study attempts to identify the determinants of their yields. It finds evidence that the issued amount, bond rating, subscription of the UN Principles for Responsible Banking, Euribor, V2X, and GDP exert a negative and statistically significant impact on green bond yields. In contrast, the time to maturity, coupon rate, currency, green bond indicator, debt-to-GDP ratio, and CPI post a positive and statistically significant effect on green bond yields. The outbreak of the pandemic led to the diminution of the intensity of the drivers, whereas the start of the vaccination period resulted in their rebound. Consequently, simply bearing the green bond label does not lead to a decrease but rather an increase in the bond yield - potentially perceived as greenwashing. In contrast, the subscription of the Green Bond Principles is probably considered a more genuine act and therefore results in a yield decrease. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Labeling; Bond Ratings; Greenwashing; Financial Markets,Labeling; Bond ratings; Greenwashing; Financial markets,,"Alessi, Lucia, What greenium matters in the stock market?

The paper also examines the involvement of banks in the green economic transition and the various challenges. The study is based on the review of articles and research works regarding the emergence of green banks, especially in Tunisia (2018– 2022); it also collected information and statistics from the websites and reports of Tunisian banks. The results of this work showed the critical role played by the Central Bank of Tunisia in encouraging banks to move towards greening the system. Also, several Tunisian banks are aware of the seriousness of climate change and have tried to implement several initiatives and services to accelerate green growth. However, Tunisia still needs to catch up with developed and some developing countries. Our findings help bankers and regulators better address climate change and its effect on the financial sector to achieve greater financial stability. These results contribute to banking in Tunisia by providing bankers and regulators with new tools to manage the impact of climate change on the banking sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Finance; Green Bonds; Green Finance; Greens Banking; Tunisia,,,"Ben Abdelmalek, Maroua, Study of trends and mapping of drought events in Tunisia and their impacts on agricultural production, Science of the Total Environment, 734, (2020); African Development Bank Launches A Model for Deploying Green Finance Across the Continent French, (2022); undefined; Amouri, Abdellatif, Technological propensity, financial constraints, and entrepreneurial limits in young entrepreneurs’ social business enterprises: The tunisian experience, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 173, (2021); Aslam, Wajeeha, Green banking adoption practices: improving environmental, financial, and operational performance, International Journal of Ethics and Systems, 39, 4, pp. 820-840, (2023); Attig-Bahar, Faten, Wind energy deployment in Tunisia: Status, Drivers, Barriers and Research gaps—A Comprehensive review, Energy Reports, 7, pp. 7374-7389, (2021); Ayari, Jamel, Trace metal element pollution in media from the abandoned Pb and Zn mine of Lakhouat, Northern Tunisia, Journal of Geochemical Exploration, 247, (2023); Azad, Mohammad Abul Kalam, Revisiting the Current Status of Green Finance and Sustainable Finance Disbursement: A Policy Insights, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022); Ecolo Energy French; Besser, Houda, Ecologic and economic perspectives for sustainable irrigated agriculture under arid climate conditions: An analysis based on environmental indicators for southern Tunisia, Journal of African Earth Sciences, 177, (2021)",,"EnPress Publisher, LLC",,25727931; 25727923,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172777657,

Sustainability has a bearing on every industry at all levels. The insurance sector is not an exception and shows a remarkable interest in matters related to sustainability. Sustainable insurance businesses require multi-dimensional interventions of eco-innovation and creativity. Increasing contradictions between economic growth and environmental issues have become an important issue for businesses worldwide. The societal and technological responses to climate change threats are rapidly developing and there is still a lack of efficient financial strategies to mitigate sustainable risks. To achieve insurance business success, many insurers focus constantly on their growth in increasing their market share and retaining better risks. Insurers should always look for new ways to differentiate themselves from their competitors. In developing and offering new green products and services-related to potential sustainability, green insurance movement is the new wave and can be the solution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Busch, Timo, The robustness of the corporate social and financial performance relation: A second-order meta-analysis, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 25, 4, pp. 583-608, (2018); Climate Loss and Damage in Africa Massive Costs on the Horizon, (2022); Chen, Haitao, Research on institutional innovation of China's green insurance investment, Journal of Industrial Integration and Management, 4, 1, (2019); Evaluating Business Success in the Microinsurance Industry of South Africa, (2012); Journal of Economics, (2014); Journal of Reviews on Global Economics, (2019); Economy and Society, (2021); Strategic Business Risk 2008 Insurance, (2008); Losses from Climate Change 145 Billion in A Decade, (2022); Awareness of Climate Risks and Opportunities Empirical Evidence on Determinants and Value from the US and European Insurance Industry, (2020)",,IGI Global,,,9781668489710; 9781668489697,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168430631,

Rather than treating it as a novel development from the perspective of climate policy, we examine net-zero in the context of the longer history and experience of the “no-net-loss” framing from biodiversity policy. Drawing on material from scholarly, policy and activist literature and cultural political economy theory, we interpret the turn to “net” policies and practices as part of the political economy of neoliberalism, in which the quantification and commodification of the environment, and in particular—trading through an offset market, enable continued ideological dominance of economic freedoms. This analysis highlights the ways in which the adoption of a “net” framing reconstructs the goals, processes and mechanisms involved. It is the neoliberal commitment to markets that drives the adoption of net framings for the very purpose of validating offsetting markets. Understanding the making of “net” measures in this way highlights the potential to disentangle the “net” from the “offset”, and we discuss the various obfuscations and perversities this entanglement affords. We argue that the delivery of net outcomes might be separated from the mechanism of offsetting, and the marketization of compensation it is typically presumed to involve, but may yet remain entangled in neoliberal political ideology. In conclusion we suggest some conditions for more effective, fair and sustainable delivery of “net-zero” climate policy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biodiversity Policies; Climate Policies; Neoliberalism; Net-zero; Offsetting,,DM acknowledges support from the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas) within the National Research Programme on Climate Visions and Conditions for a Fossil-Free Welfare Society (Grant No. 2019-01973) and from LUNETs (Linköping University Negative Emission Technologies)–Linköping University ( liu.se ).,"Adams, William M., Geographies of conservation I: De-extinction and precision conservation, Progress in Human Geography, 41, 4, pp. 534-545, (2017); Anderson, Kevin L., The trouble with negative emissions, Science, 354, 6309, pp. 182-183, (2016); Apostolopoulou, Elia, Biodiversity offsetting and conservation: Reframing nature to save it, Oryx, 51, 1, pp. 23-31, (2017); Armstrong, Chris, Which Net Zero?

Due to the turbulence in nature, many countries are promoting pathways for environmental development at par with economic growth and are “Going Green”. It is the need of the hour and Banks being the backbone of the economy and of prime importance can help in providing with the ideas and vision for financing portfolio projects that create a strong and successful low carbon economy. The objective of the study is to highlight the responsiveness of banks in India towards the environmental uproar and to understand the action plan towards adoption of green banking practices. In the study parameters based on awareness, implementation, gaps and drivers for green banking practices in India have been studied. The performance of regional rural banks has also been mapped to study the level of their participation in green banking. The research has been conducted using a structured questionnaire in addition to the secondary data obtained from published reports. The results show that only a very small subset of Indian banks have recognized the opportunity of green banking and are vigilant in dealing with environmental issues. Also on a global front, despite a number of initiatives taken and the potential opportunities arising, Indian banks have shown a tepid response. This is evident from the number of signatories in United Nations Environmental Program­-Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI, 2014) where only two of them are Indian namely, Yes Bank Ltd and Infrastructure Finance and Leasing Corporation. The main deterrent for Indian banks probably is the risk of losing business to competition whereas the major drivers are shareholder pressure and improvement in brand equity and value addition. For making the topic of green banking more inclusive, clear RBI mandate, training and development, reduction of information asymmetry will play a pivotal role. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brand Equity; Going Green; Green Banking; Low Carbon Economy; Portfolio Project; Sustainable Development,,,"Green Banking Report by Idrbt, (2013); Trends in Global Co 2 Emissions Report, (2013); Does It Pay to Be Green an Empirical Examination of the Relationship Between Emissions Reduction and Firm Performance, (1995); Sustainable Finance and Banking the Financial Sector and the Future of the Planet, (2001); Biography of A Subject an Evolution of Development Economics, (2005); Indian Economic Journal, (2007); Cab Calling, (2008); Sustainable Financing for Indian Banks, (2008); Working Paper Submitted to Institute of Economic Growth, (2008); Business Spectrum, (2011)",,Manakin Press,,,9781032515014; 9781000898934,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165081441,

One avenue to meet these challenges is to integrate ESG risks into Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in order to improve control and reporting. The aim of this chapter is to examine ESG risk integration by focusing on: (1) How ESG risk is integrated with control, i.e. incorporated into strategic and operational decision-making; and (2) How ESG is integrated into reporting, i.e. incorporated into financial and sustainability reports. Our analytical framework conceptualizes integration as a technical-social process, which has three integrating dimensions and five integrating components. We use a qualitative approach and conduct short case studies in four ESG leading Swedish organizations. The study finds that social processes are important in ESG integration and lead to increased integration on the cognitive dimension. Findings also show how technical processes support social processes, however the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in ESG risk management in the organizations is low, as is internal audits role in promoting ESG risk control effectiveness and reporting quality.

This has led banks and asset managers to shun the oil and gas industry, leading to significant underperformance of oil and gas stocks. The sector’s low valuations left it vulnerable to takeovers, breakups, and buyouts by national oil companies. It seemed that the public financial markets would soon be closed to the industry altogether. Recent events, including the Russia-Ukraine War and the SEC’s climate disclosures requirements, may have changed that.

However, to achieve this at scale requires a systematic framework for scoping, assessing, and targeting native revegetation opportunities in a way that addresses national-scale priorities, supports landscape-scale ecological processes, and recognises that land use decisions are made at farm-scales by landowners. In this forum discussion, we outline the requirements for a spatial decision support system for native revegetation; we provide illustrations of national-, landscape-, and farm-scale components of this framework and outline a range of organisational, societal, and scientific challenges that must be addressed to enable effective and targeted revegetation across the country.

Climate change scenarios suggest more frequent and severe physical climate hazards in the future, coinciding with greater exposure of populations to such threats. This raises concern because changes in property prices pose risks to homeowners’ financial status, as well as to the insurance and mortgage industries, bank portfolios, and thereby financial systems. We begin with a new definition of climate gentrification (CG) that captures links between physical climate hazards, perceptions of risk and resilience, and capital flows in property markets. This is followed by a structured assessment of the key drivers of CG, and an empirical case study of property data for a flood-prone UK city to demonstrate how CG depressed house price growth over the period from 2005 to 2018 by up to 50 percent in flood-exposed (relative to unexposed) locations. We then provide a discussion of ethical concerns around CG research, with suggested ways forward. Such price signals have potential ramifications for the long-term stability of real estate markets and raise policy implications for private and public sectors. We conclude with some priorities for further research into CG, recognizing key information and data gaps, and noting how existing knowledge and tools could contribute toward improved resilience to climate change.

S&P 500 non-financial firms during 2010–2019 are analysed and we employ both corporate carbon footprints and climate risk disclosures in annual filings to measure climate risk. Our results show that climate risk has a negative impact on firms' distance to default. This impact is limited to the disclosure of transition risk in annual filings. In contrast, disclosures of physical or non-specific risk do not affect firm-level default risk, while the impact of corporate carbon footprints is inconsistent but insignificant in most models. We also find that the negative effect of climate transition risk on firms' distance to default is stronger for firms headquartered in states with carbon pricing (California and states covered by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative) and temporarily strengthens because of the Paris Agreement in 2015. However, this ‘Paris’ effect is short-lived and fades away in subsequent years. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Climate Finance; Climate Risk Disclosure; Merton Distance To Default,,"Funding text 1: Quyen Nguyen acknowledges funding from an Otago Business School Strategic Scholarship.

Specifically, we match machine learning predictions of corporate carbon footprints to syndicated loans initiated in 2010–2018 and aggregate these to loan portfolios of the twenty largest banks in the United States. Banks vary in their climate transition risk not only due to their exposure to the energy sectors but also due to borrowers' carbon emission profiles from other sectors. Banks generally lend a minimal amount to coal (0.4%) but hold a considerable exposure in oil and gas (8.6%) and electricity firms (4.6%) and thus have a large exposure to the energy sectors (13.5%). We observe that climate transition risk profile was stable over time, save for a temporary (in some cases) and permanent (in others), reduction in their fossil-fuel exposure after the Paris Agreement. From the stress testing, the median loss is 0.5% of US syndicated loans, representing a decrease in CET1 capital of 4.1% when extrapolated to the whole balance sheet. The loss is twice as large in the 1.5°C scenarios (1.4%–2.1% of loan value, 12%–16% of CET1 capital) compared to the 2°C target (0.6%–1.1% of loan value, 5%–9% of CET1 capital) with significant tail-end risk (7.7% of loan value, 62% of CET1 capital). Banks' vulnerabilities are also driven by the ex-ante financial risk of their borrowers more generally, highlighting that climate risk is not independent from conventional risks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bank Risk; Climate Risk; Corporate Loans; Stress Testing; Syndicated Loans,,"Funding text 1: Quyen Nguyen acknowledges funding from an Otago Business School Strategic Scholarship.

Of late, banks have focused on sustainable management in order to improve their environmental footprint, to eliminate financial risks, to promote social issues, and to exploit new opportunities. The sustainable development management of organizations attracts new customers over and above conventional institutions thus leading to greater market share and increased revenues. This paper aims to examine if and how sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by banking institutions play a role in customers’ decisions and behavior. The way that banks, SDGs, and sustainable image affect customer behavior, attitudes, trust, loyalty, satisfaction, and perceived fair pricing policy is assessed. To this end, 1084 questionnaires were collected and the PLS-SEM method was utilized. The findings show a positive relationship between the stance of banks relating to SDGs and customer trust, loyalty, and perceived fair pricing policy. Finally, the SDGs adopted by banks are an important strategic tool which strengthens relationship with their customers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking Customers; Customer Awareness; Customer Trust; Loyalty And Behavior; Sdgs; Sustainability Practices; Banking; Consumption Behavior; Pricing Policy; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Attitude; Consumer Attitude; Policy; Questionnaire; Attitude; Consumer Behavior; Policy; Surveys And Questionnaires; Sustainable Development,banking; consumption behavior; pricing policy; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; attitude; consumer attitude; policy; questionnaire; Attitude; Consumer Behavior; Policy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sustainable Development,The authors would like to thank the Editor and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments from which the present paper greatly improved.

Transnational networks can fill this governance gap to steer climate finance in such a situation. This paper examines 63 climate finance networks, including public, private, and hybrid ones, to analyse networks’ functions and determine when they emerged and how they are institutionalized. Most of the networks arose recently when bottom-up efforts began to be widely adopted as a way to mainstream finance combating climate change. In contrast to public networks, private and hybrid networks more frequently display firmly defined forms of institutionalization, such as requirements for members to pay a fee and carry out compulsory actions. In addition, private and hybrid networks tend to take on the governance functions of target setting and rule making more than public networks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Governance Through Goals; Non-state Actors; Transnational Networks,,"Supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers, the CIP was established by Ecofys, the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), and the World Resources Institute in 2014 (Fenhann et al. ).","Abbott, Kenneth W., The transnational regime complex for climate change, Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 30, 4, pp. 571-590, (2012); Abbott, Kenneth W., The governance triangle: Regulatory standards institutions and the shadow of the state, pp. 44-88, (2009); Abbott, Kenneth W., Taking responsive regulation transnational: Strategies for international organizations, Regulation and Governance, 7, 1, pp. 95-113, (2013); Andonova, Liliana B., Transnational climate governance, Global Environmental Politics, 9, 2, pp. 52-73, (2009); Andonova, Liliana B., National policy and transnational governance of climate change: Substitutes or complements?, International Studies Quarterly, 61, 2, pp. 253-268, (2017); Ayling, Julie, Non-state governance and climate policy: the fossil fuel divestment movement, Climate Policy, 17, 2, pp. 131-149, (2017); Bache, Ian, Themes and Issues in Multi-level Governance, (2004); Bäckstrand, Karin, The democratic legitimacy of orchestration: the UNFCCC, non-state actors, and transnational climate governance, Environmental Politics, 26, 4, pp. 764-788, (2017); Bécault, Emilie, The global governance system for climate finance: Towards greater institutional integrity?, pp. 93-117, (2016); Compromise of Liberal Environmentalism, (2001)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,20430795; 20430809,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106246635,

Despite efforts to maximize social benefits from climate, development, and conservation, externally driven processes can converge to amplify vulnerabilities and inequalities. Pre-existing social injustices increase the sensitivity of affected individuals to change and limit their capacity to adapt or benefit from the interacting impacts of triple exposure. We argue that external implementors cannot effectively and equitably achieve climate, economic, and conservation goals without prioritizing social justice and building general resilience. We therefore recommend that implementors: (1) address root causes of vulnerability, namely pre-existing social injustices; (2) use participatory systems approaches to improve understanding of local contexts and potential consequences of proposed initiatives; and (3) leverage inclusive partnerships to facilitate collaborative design and implementation. These strategies—applied together and adapted to local contexts—can support well-being, justice, and resilience within coastal communities experiencing rapid change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blue economy; blue growth; climate change; conservation; equity; justice; social-ecological system; sustainability; transformation; vulnerability,climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; conservation management; social justice; sustainability; vulnerability,"We would like to thank the Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP), for facilitating a convening space for many of the authors to discuss this work, and the members of the Coastal Outcomes Working Group for their ideas that helped shape this article.

The relevance of the ocean for humanity's future is undisputed. However, the ocean’s great potential to drive economic growth and equitable job creation, sustain healthy ecosystems, and mitigate climate change is not yet fully recognised. Lack of awareness of this potential as well as management and governance challenges pose impediments. Until these impediments are removed, ocean ecosystems will continue to be degraded and opportunities for people lost. A transition and a clear path to a thriving and vibrant relationship between humans and the ocean are urgently needed. This open access collection of papers and reports identifies a path that is inspired by science, energised by engaged people, and emboldened by visionary leaders. These assessments of knowledge are commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel), which was established in September 2018 as a unique initiative led by heads of state and government from around the world, to showcase the latest leading-edge science, knowledge and state-of-the-art thinking on key ocean issues. Altogether, The Blue Compendium offers innovative ocean solutions in technology, policy, governance, and finance realms, that could help accelerate a transition to a more sustainable and prosperous relationship with the ocean. The comprehensive assessments have already informed policy making at the highest levels of government and motivated an impressive array of responsive and ambitious action across a growing network of leaders in business, finance and civil society. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Food from the ocean; Marine biodiversity; Ocean and climate change; Ocean and economy; Ocean resource management; Open Access; Sustainable ocean,Biodiversity; Economics; Ecosystems; Information use; Marine biology; Oceanography; Public policy; Carbon A; Food from the ocean; Marine biodiversity; Ocean and climate change; Ocean and economy; Ocean resource management; Ocean resources; OpenAccess; Resource management; Sustainable ocean; Open access,,"Aas, Turid Synnøve, Utilization of feed resources in the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Norway: An update for 2016, Aquaculture Reports, 15, (2019); Abate, Tenaw Gedefaw, Stringency of environmental regulation and aquaculture growth: A cross-country analysis, Aquaculture Economics and Management, 20, 2, pp. 201-221, (2016); Aquaculture Fisheries Poverty and Food Security, (2011); Amundson, Ronald G., Soil and human security in the 21st century, Science, 348, 6235, (2015); Globefish Res Program, (2015); Belton, Ben, Not just for the wealthy: Rethinking farmed fish consumption in the Global South, Global Food Security, 16, pp. 85-92, (2018); Bronnmann, Julia, Sustainable Seafood From Aquaculture and Wild Fisheries: Insights From a Discrete Choice Experiment in Germany, Ecological Economics, 142, pp. 113-119, (2017); Short Term Projection of Global Fish Demand and Supply Gaps, (2017); Cao, Ling, China's aquaculture and the world's wild fisheries, Science, 347, 6218, pp. 133-135, (2015); Cashion, Tim, Global reduction fisheries and their products in the context of sustainable limits, Fish and Fisheries, 18, 6, pp. 1026-1037, (2017)",,Springer International Publishing,,,9783031162763; 9783031162770,,,English,Book,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169361626,

In response to these EU requirements, Ireland has introduced the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) and Maritime Area Planning Act, 2021 (MAPA) in 2021 to deliver this sustainable blue economy. This new marine and coastal governance framework in Ireland reforms the consenting regime for key blue economy sectors such as Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) and sets new policy requirements for the integration of aquaculture within the MSP framework. However, the exclusion of aquaculture from the new consenting regime may hinder the full integration of the sector into MSP and impede compliance with environmental goals established by EU Directives (e.g., WFD, MSFD, MSPD). This review identifies policy and legal gaps which may impede the integration of aquaculture into the new Irish marine governance and national MSP process. Furthermore, this paper analyses aquaculture licensing cases to assess the integration of environmental criteria into planning decisions to gather insight into the readiness of the sector’s transition towards a sustainable model. The analysis from this paper indicates that the legal framework underpinning MSP in Ireland may have a limited impact on the integration of aquaculture and hinder the delivery of sustainability across all marine sectors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",aquaculture governance; Ireland marine management; marine spatial planning (MSP); new blue deal; UN ocean decade,,"Funding text 1: Part of this work was supported by the Navigate project (under Grant-Aid Agreement No. 842 PBA/IPG/17/01 awarded to Dr O’Hagan) and carried out with the support of the Marine Institute and funded under the Marine Research Programme by the Irish government, and by MaREI – the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine (12/RC/2302).

With few exceptions, the status quo does not meet the diverse development aspirations of coastal communities or ensure healthy oceans for current and future generations. The blue economy is expected to grow to USD2.5–3 trillion by 2030, and there is particular interest in its potential to alleviate poverty in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, and to support a blue recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a selective, thematic review of the blue economy literature to examine: (i) the opportunities and risks for coastal communities, (ii) the barriers and enablers that shape community engagement, and (iii) the strategies employed by communities and supporting organizations, which can be strengthened to deliver a ‘sustainable' blue economy and improve social justice for coastal communities. Our review finds that under business-as-usual and blue growth, industrial fisheries, large-scale aquaculture, land reclamation, mining, and oil and gas raise red flags for communities and marine ecosystems. Whereas, if managed sustainably, small-scale fisheries, coastal aquaculture, seaweed farming and eco-tourism are the most likely to deliver benefits to communities. Yet, these are also the sectors most vulnerable to negative and cumulative impacts from other sectors. Based on our evaluation of enablers, barriers and strategies, the paper argues that putting coastal communities at the center of a clear vision for an inclusive Sustainable Blue Economy and co-developing a shared and accessible language for communities, practitioners and policy-makers is essential for a more equitable ocean economy, alongside mainstreaming social justice principles and integrated governance that can bridge different scales of action and opportunity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blue economy; coastal communities; justice; marine; sustainability,,This research was funded by WWF.,"Akıncı, Merter, Inequality and economic growth: Trickle-down effect revisited, Development Policy Review, 36, pp. O1-O24, (2018); Béné, Christophe, Contribution of Fisheries and Aquaculture to Food Security and Poverty Reduction: Assessing the Current Evidence, World Development, 79, pp. 177-196, (2016); Bennett, Nathan J., Blue growth and blue justice: Ten risks and solutions for the ocean economy, Marine Policy, 125, (2021); Bennett, Nathan J., Towards a sustainable and equitable blue economy, Nature Sustainability, 2, 11, pp. 991-993, (2019); Boonstra, Wiebren J., The quality of compliance: investigating fishers’ responses towards regulation and authorities, Fish and Fisheries, 18, 4, pp. 682-697, (2017); Bradford, Jessica, Exploring community-based marine aquaculture as a coastal resource management opportunity in Nova Scotia, Canada, Facets, 5, 1, pp. 26-48, (2020); Campbell, Lisa M., From Vegetable Box to Seafood Cooler: Applying the Community-Supported Agriculture Model to Fisheries, Society and Natural Resources, 27, 1, pp. 88-106, (2014); Campbell, Lisa M., From Blue Economy to Blue Communities: reorienting aquaculture expansion for community wellbeing, Marine Policy, 124, (2021); Deep Sea Mining Artisanal Fishers Call for the Protection of Livelihoods Against Deep Sea Mining, (2022); Chen, Sulan, Blue economy: Community case studies addressing the poverty-environment nexus in ocean and coastal management, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 11, (2020)",,Frontiers Media S.A.,,26733145,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149419893,

This book explores the impact of environmental risk on the banking sector and analyzes strategies to mitigate this risk with a special emphasis on the role of modelling. It argues that environmental risk modelling allows banks to estimate the patterns and consequences of environmental risk on their operations, and to take measures within the context of asset and liability management to minimize the likelihood of losses. An important role here is played by the environmental risk modelling methodology as well as the software and mathematical and econometric models used. It examines banks' responses to macroprudential risk, particularly from the point of view of their adaptation strategies; the mechanisms of its spread; risk management and modelling; and sustainable business models. It introduces the basic concepts, definitions, and regulations concerning this type of risk, within the context of its influence on the banking industry. The book is primarily based on a quantitative and qualitative approach and proposes the delivery of a new methodology of environmental risk management and modelling in the banking sector. As such, it will appeal to researchers, scholars, and students of environmental economics, finance and banking, sociology, law, and political sciences. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Abad, Pilar, A comprehensive review of Value at Risk methodologies, Spanish Review of Financial Economics, 12, 1, pp. 15-32, (2014); Proceedings of the 2014 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, (2014); Oxford Handbook of the Economics of Networks, (2015); A First Assessment of Financial Risks Stemming from Climate Change the Main Results of the 2020 Climate Pilot Exercise, (2021); Ald Reliability and Safety Tools, (2022); Ald Software Architecture, (2022); Stability and Sustainability in Banking Reform are Environmental Risks Missing in Basel III, (2014); Climate Related Scenarios for Financial Stability Assessment an Application to France, (2025); undefined, (2019); Occasional Paper Series, (2021)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781000823240; 9781032315119,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143102415,

The aim of this policy is to make the private sector take into account sustainability-related non-financial factors when making financing and investment decisions. Within this framework, the EU Taxonomy provides a uniform definition and classification system of environmentally sustainable economic activities. In addition, the EU Taxonomy itself provides the basis for further legislation and regulation. Banks as the main financiers of firms in Europe and therefore important players in directing capital flows towards sustainable projects are thus targeted with several requirements based on the Taxonomy. The question then is how banks' lending to firms is affected by these regulatory changes and whether an impact on the greening of firms' economic activities can be achieved. The existing literature provides evidence that firms' environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, profiles and performance influence their loan conditions, but it is unclear whether better funding conditions lead to reduced carbon emissions or ""greener""activities at the firm level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bank Lending; Banks; Eu Taxonomy; Sustainable Finance,,,"Esg Disclosure Landscape for Banks and Capital Markets in Europe, (2021); Financing the Response to Climate Change the Pricing and Ownership of U S Green Bonds, (2018); Becchetti, Leonardo, Making Information on CSR Scores Salient: A Randomized Field Experiment, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 81, 6, pp. 1193-1213, (2019); Bank Green Bonds, (2021); there is no Planet B but for Banks there are Countries B to Z Domestic Climate Policy and Cross Border Bank Lending, (2022); Berg, Florian, Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings*, Review of Finance, 26, 6, pp. 1315-1344, (2022); Brühl, Volker, Green Finance in Europe — Strategy, Regulation and Instruments, Intereconomics, 56, 6, pp. 323-330, (2021); European Green Bond Regulation, (2022); European Green Deal, (2019); Strategy for Financing the Transition to A Sustainable Economy, (2021)",,De Gruyter Open Ltd,,21946167; 15533832,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147228270,

However, the socio-economic and ecological value of ponds is often underestimated compared to the larger water bodies. Ponds are highly vulnerable to mounting land-use pressures (e.g., urban expansion, and agriculture intensification) and environmental changes, leading to degradation and loss of the pond ecosystem. The narrow utilitarian use-based conservation fails to recognize the multiple anthropogenic pressures and provides narrow solutions which are inefficient to regenerate the degraded pond ecosystem. In this paper, we holistically examined the legal challenges (policies) and key anthropogenic and environmental pressures responsible for pond degradation in India. The country is strongly dedicated to attaining SDG and circular economy (CE) through aquatic ecosystem conservation and restoration. Considerable efforts are required at the administration level to recognize the contribution of pond ecosystem services in attaining global environmental goals and targets. Worldwide restoration strategies were reviewed, and a framework for pond restoration and conservation was proposed, which includes policies and incentives, technologies such as environmental-DNA (e-DNA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and other ecohydrological measures. Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer a sustainable and cost-effective approach to restoring the pond’s natural processes. Furthermore, linkage between the pond ecosystem and the CE was assessed to encourage a regenerative system for biodiversity conservation. This study informs the need for extensive actions and legislative reforms to restore and conserve the pond ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Circular Economy; Conservation; Policies; Ponds; Restoration; Sustainability; Aquatic Ecosystem; Conservation; Pond; Restoration Ecology; Sustainability; India,aquatic ecosystem; conservation; pond; restoration ecology; sustainability; India,"Funding text 1: We are also thankful to the National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Roorkee, India, for providing the necessary resources needed for this study.; Funding text 2: We are grateful to the Department of Science and Technology (Government of India) for funding the project “Innovation Centre for Eco-Prudent Wastewater Solutions (IC-EcoWS; grants number- DST/TM/WTI/WIC/2k17/83)”.","Adhikari, Kushal, Water sustainability using pond-in-pond wastewater treatment system: Case studies, Journal of Water Process Engineering, 36, (2020); Amaraneni, Sreenivasa Rao, Distribution of pesticides, PAHs and heavy metals in prawn ponds near Kolleru lake wetland, India, Environment International, 32, 3, pp. 294-302, (2006); Bassi, Nitin, Status of wetlands in India: A review of extent, ecosystem benefits, threats and management strategies, Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 2, pp. 1-19, (2014); Ishita Bhatnagar, Simple Methodology for Estimating the Groundwater Recharge Potential of Rural Ponds and Lakes Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques: a Spatiotemporal Case Study of Roorkee Tehsil, India, Water Resources, 47, 2, pp. 200-210, (2020); International Letters of Natural Sciences, (2015); Bhattacharyya, Ranjan, Soil degradation in india: Challenges and potential solutions, Sustainability (Switzerland), 7, 4, pp. 3528-3570, (2015); Biggs, Jeremy N., Using eDNA to develop a national citizen science-based monitoring programme for the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), Biological Conservation, 183, pp. 19-28, (2015); Bordós, Gábor, Identification of microplastics in fish ponds and natural freshwater environments of the Carpathian basin, Europe, Chemosphere, 216, pp. 110-116, (2019); Brans, Kristien I., Urban hot-tubs: Local urbanization has profound effects on average and extreme temperatures in ponds, Landscape and Urban Planning, 176, pp. 22-29, (2018); Bugg, Robert Alan, Performance evaluations of three silt fence practices using a full-scale testing apparatus, Water (Switzerland), 9, 7, (2017)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,02775212; 19436246,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141398957,

Firms that take measures aimed at managing climate risk, including corporate climate strategy, board-level governance, specific or integrated process to cope with climate change, climate opportunities, and climate policy involvement, are able to mitigate the negative impact of climate risk on loan contracting. We further find that higher climate risk level is associated with inferior financial performance and higher default probability, which potentially lead to more stringent loan terms. Managerial Summary: We examine how a firm's exposure to climate risk affects its financing terms from bank loans. Climate risk exposure is assessed by firm managers and also reflects the degree to which the firm is subject to climate-induced natural disasters. The results show that if exposed to higher climate risk, which hurts financial performance and heightens default likelihood, firms face higher interest rates and more stringent collateral and covenant constraints when borrowing from banks. Nevertheless, firm managers could significantly mitigate this adverse climate impact on loan financing by integrating climate change into business strategy, having the board take direct responsibility for climate change issues, establishing a climate change-focused risk management process, seeking business opportunities from climate change, and engaging in activities that influence climate policies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bank Loan Terms; Climate Risk Management; Credit Risk; Financial Performance; Firm Climate Risk; Climate Change; Disasters; Finance; Managers; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Bank Loan Term; Bank Loans; Climate Policy; Climate Risk Management; Corporates; Credit Risks; Financial Performance; Firm Climate Risk; Risks Management; Stringents; Risk Management,Climate change; Disasters; Finance; Managers; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Bank loan term; Bank loans; Climate policy; Climate risk management; Corporates; Credit risks; Financial performance; Firm climate risk; Risks management; Stringents; Risk management,"Funding text 1: HKIBS Research Seed Fund, Faculty of Business, Lingnan University, Grant/Award Number: 190‐008; Start‐up fund of Hong Kong Polytechnic University Funding information; Funding text 2: The authors are grateful for helpful comments from Aaron Chatterji (editor), two anonymous reviewers, Brian Bratten, Nicole Jenkins, Yue Ma, Linda Myers, Florin Vasvari, Hong Xie, Teri Yohn, Jian Zhou, and seminar participants at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, University of Kentucky, and Yeshiva University.

This endeavour will require the implementation of various strategies aiming for a system reset, at the core of which is the sustainable recovery model. In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 22 April as International Mother Earth Day. It was a brave act of acknowledgement that the Earth and its ecosystems are our typical home. At the same time, it is a tangible expression of the global conviction that humankind must be in Harmony with Nature to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of present and future generations. While the global community is actively searching for new ways to achieve sustainable development, resolved to perform an economic system reset, determined to a green recovery, why don't we try to reform the taxing system? A right taxation system could help recover quickly and achieve a green recovery of the global economy. While everyone has to pay tax, the truth is that some more prominent companies go to extreme measures to minimise their contribution where they are based and where they sell.

The responsibility of banks for animal welfare is underscored by the drive towards greater investment in animal agribusiness, and the vicious cycle through which animal agribusiness can both contribute to, and be impacted by, climate disruption. The article evaluates, through a desktop review, how leading Australian retail banks and agribusiness lenders are addressing animal welfare and climate disruption in animal agribusiness lending. We find that although most banks have made a commitment to animal welfare and climate policies, these often amount to little more than greenwashing. We call for an ecosystem of industry, regulatory, and civil society action to address this danger. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Environmental Social Governance; Factory Farming; Responsible Banking; Responsible Investment; Sustainable Finance,,,"Animal Welfare Principles, (2020); Sustainability Report 2019, (2020); Abc News Online, (2019); Greens Media Release, (2019); Media Release, (2019); Media Release, (2019); Submission to the Inquiry into the Prudential Regulation of Investment in Australias Export Industries; Weekly Times, (2020); Principles for Responsible Banking, (2019); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2025)",,Cambridge University Press,,20471033; 20471025,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143213183,

Mining and mining products are major contributors to national economies with mining value tripling in the past two decades. As of 2020, the global mining footprint was 57,000 km2 and growing at a faster rate now than any other time in human history. Much of this footprint is operational, but in many areas where mining is now complete, the sites represent major environmental liabilities. Although site stabilization and managing waste materials remains a challenging part of mine closure in many parts of the world, the environmental liability of these sites means more than being just safe, stable, and nonpolluting, with companies increasingly expected to restore ecosystems that are representative of their pre-mined (natural) state. The International Principles and Standards for the Ecological Restoration and Recovery of Mine Sites (Mine Site Restoration Standards, MSRS) present the first international framework for the delivery of socially and environmentally responsible ecological restoration after mining, regardless of whether restoration is legally mandated. The MSRS are designed to inspire and drive higher and better outcomes in post-mining landscapes by both guiding and encouraging the highest level of restoration achievable that supports the global need for protecting and restoring nature. This comes at a time of unparalleled global human impacts where climate change, land degradation, and biodiversity loss threaten the very ecological fabric of the planet. Mining companies are a major global player in local and regional economies and by demonstrating leadership in protecting, enhancing, and restoring the environments in which they operate, they can maintain, and enhance their social license to operate. The MSRS aim to provide a framework for the mining industry, governments, and stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples and local communities, to address mining-specific issues in delivering effective restoration of mine sites. The MSRS emphasize that achieving the highest possible ecological outcomes depends upon ingenuity, knowledge investment, and a supportive corporate ethos to build a culture of continuous improvement. This approach will maximize benefits for local communities, the environment, and ultimately the mining industry. For industry, the MSRS provide a framework that can be utilized to optimize restoration outcomes that will leave a positive legacy long after mining has ceased. Early adoption of the MSRS by industry can reduce environmental, financial, and corporate risk in achieving site relinquishment by demonstrating the highest possible commitment to stakeholders, increasing natural capital, responding to climate change and, recovering biodiversity, including threatened and culturally significant species. The agreed-upon post-mining land use (PMLU), in some cases, is the same general land use that was present prior to disturbance, which often includes fully functioning intact native ecosystems. In other cases, the PMLU may be different from the pre-mining condition. Regardless, the potential for ecological restoration should not be invoked as a justification for destroying or damaging existing native ecosystems. When native ecosystems are impacted by mining, full recovery informed by reference models should be the target. Where this is not achievable a “recovery gap” between the initial native ecosystem and the post-mining ecosystem is created. In highly man-altered landscapes, processes and approaches to mine site restoration may require local solutions but should be undertaken within the Principles of these Standards. When followed, the MSRS can help limit the recovery gap, and where possible (e.g., if mining is implemented in an ecosystem that had previously been highly degraded by other activities), close that gap and move toward net ecological gain. The Standards are underpinned by eight principles that provide a framework to enable restoration decisions that are evidence-based, resilient, and acceptable to mining companies, communities, and stakeholders. They are: Engage stakeholders throughout the life of mine. Draw on many types of knowledge. Be informed by reference ecosystems, while considering environmental change. Support ecosystem recovery processes. Assess against clear goals and objectives, using measurable indicators. Seek the highest level of recovery attainable. Gain cumulative value when applied at large scales. Employ a continuum of restorative activities. The MSRS recommend not just best practice, but future practice that harnesses the unique investment and technical capacity of the mining industry and applies it toward the most restorative post-mining practices possible. These Standards align with the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, The Mitigation Hierarchy, and international best practice in ecological restoration. They build on the International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration with key concepts customized to meet the unique challenges of global mining. The MSRS represent a living document that will evolve and develop as technological ability, community and environmental expectations, and understanding of mine site restoration changes over time. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Mine Closure; Mine Site Restoration; Mining; Rehabilitation; Social License; Trajectory; Anthropogenic Effect; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Land Degradation; Mine; Mining Industry; Restoration Ecology; Trajectory,anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; land degradation; mine; mining industry; restoration ecology; trajectory,"Funding text 1: This document and content development was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre for Mine Site Restoration (ICI150100041), including time from Renee Young, George Gann and Kingsley Dixon.

Institutional investors who invest in fossil fuels can potentially influence the energy transition. However, few papers investigate how investors can leverage their collective resources to accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels. Hence, this paper asks: How do investor initiatives inform or shape efforts of institutional investors to align with the Paris Agreement and what are the implications of these for a goal of leaving fossil fuels underground? We identify 41 investor initiatives through a document analysis and use a sectoral governance perspective to analyse initiative strategies and policies. We then examine in depth one of the largest initiatives, Climate Action 100+, supported by analysis of 55 newspaper articles. Findings indicate that while initiatives are active in providing resources to investors to assist with aligning their investments with the Paris Agreement, coordinating investor engagement, and have been successful in uniting a critical mass of investors behind climate goals ($500 billion - $106 trillion), there exist many gaps in their capacity to achieve ambitious action on climate from companies or their investor members. A lack of internal accountability, minimal transparency into their goals and timelines, and limited ambition threaten to undermine the potential for investor initiatives to be agents of climate action.

We conduct an asset-level and forward-looking risk assessment on three downstream energy assets: natural gas, coal, and solar photovoltaic power plants. We first identify climate risk factors (physical and transition) that an asset is highly exposed to with its specific asset type, geographic location, time frame, and financing structure and build plausible climate risk scenarios using single or multiple risk factors. We then project an energy asset's cash flow and estimate the asset's probability of default under the built scenarios. We compare the financial impacts of varying climate risk scenarios by analyzing the time and size of the losses due to the given default. We observe climate-related financial risks that are systematic and idiosyncratic: some scenarios affect certain energy assets negatively and others positively, while others negatively affect multiple asset types simultaneously. Our comparative case study results also show that renewable energy investments are likely to be more resilient to climate change than fossil fuel-based energy assets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cash Flow Modeling; Climate Resilience; Climate Risk Assessment; Climate Risk Scenario; Energy Infrastructure Investment; Financial Impact Assessment; Project Finance; Stranded Asset; Climate Change; Fossil Fuels; Gas Plants; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Solar Power Generation; Cash Flow Models; Climate Resilience; Climate Risk Assessment; Climate Risk Scenario; Energy Infrastructure Investment; Energy Infrastructures; Financial Impact Assessment; Financial Impacts; Impact Assessments; Infrastructure Investment; Project Finance; Risks Assessments; Risks Scenarios; Stranded Asset; Investments,Climate change; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Solar power generation; Cash flow models; Climate resilience; Climate risk assessment; Climate risk scenario; Energy infrastructure investment; Energy infrastructures; Financial impact assessment; Financial impacts; Impact assessments; Infrastructure investment; Project finance; Risks assessments; Risks scenarios; Stranded asset; Investments,"Funding text 1: This research is funded by the Stanford Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE), United States .; Funding text 2: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Soh Young In reports financial support was provided by Stanford Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE).","Climate Change 2022 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2022); McGlade, Christophe E., The geographical distribution of fossil fuels unused when limiting global warming to 2°C, Nature, 517, 7533, pp. 187-190, (2015); Battiston, Stefano, A climate stress-test of the financial system, Nature Climate Change, 7, 4, pp. 283-288, (2017); Stranded Assets A Climate Risk Challenge, (2016); Curtin, Joseph, Quantifying stranding risk for fossil fuel assets and implications for renewable energy investment: A review of the literature, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 116, (2019); Mercure, Jean François, Macroeconomic impact of stranded fossil fuel assets, Nature Climate Change, 8, 7, pp. 588-593, (2018); Financial Dynamics of the Environment Risks Impacts and Barriers to Resilience, (2014); Aligning the Financial System with Sustainable Development, (2015); Dell, Melissa, What do we learn from the weather?

What is currently missed in the academic debate is that the finance field is deeply rooted in its discipline, which creates blindfolds to crucial aspects for enabling sustainability. Many investment strategies require ample information about issues of relevance, but complete information of all sustainability aspects may never become available. In these instances, it will not be possible to use prediction models and standard mathematical methods. This sheds light on the problem with using ESG (environmental, social, governance) rating metrics in their current form. It also gives rise to questions about the usefulness of establishing a taxonomy for sustainable economic activities. The European Union's (EU's) Sustainable Finance Initiative and its affiliated Taxonomy Regulation are therefore used as a case in this chapter. The Taxonomy Regulation is symptomatic of the lack of debate about to what extent it is possible to (a) identify and (b) measure all important aspects relevant for corporate sustainability. The chapter integrates and proposes the further use of multiple policy principles, including propositions on how to translate complexity and uncertainty into methodological and legal concerns.

Regulators can indeed facilitate the reorientation of financial flows necessary for the transition. But they may find themselves walking a tightrope, having to balance exaggerated expectations against limited capabilities and political economy constraints. Their diagnostic and policy toolkits are still in their infancy. Expanding their legal mandates to take on these new, essentially political, responsibilities should be done through the political process and be accompanied by strengthened governance and accountability arrangements. Taking on these new responsibilities can also have potential pitfalls and unintended consequences on financial markets. Ultimately, central banks and financial regulators cannot deliver a low-carbon economy by themselves and should not risk being caught again in the role of 'the only game in town'. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Climate Mitigation Policy; Energy Transition; Financial Regulation; Financial Stability; Low-carbon Economy,,,"Climate Change 2022 Mitigation of Climate Change, (2025); Cat Thermometer Tm, (2021); Stern, Nicholas H., The economics of climate change, American Economic Review, 98, 2, pp. 1-37, (2008); Dasgupta, Partha Sarathi, Discounting climate change, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 37, 2-3, pp. 141-169, (2008); Weitzman, Martin L., Fat-tailed uncertainty in the economics of catastrophic climate change, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 5, 2, pp. 275-292, (2011); Acemoglu, Daron, The environment and directed technical change, American Economic Review, 102, 1, pp. 131-166, (2012); Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon Climate Change and Financial Stability, (2015); Macroeconomic and Financial Policies for Climate Change Mitigation A Review of the Literature, (2019); Stern, Nicholas H., The economics of climate change: The stern review, 9780521877251, pp. 1-692, (2007); Getting Energy Prices Right from Principle to Practice, (2014)",,Oxford University Press,,20534841; 20534833,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147535584,

It is therefore more important than ever for the mechanisms of shareholder engagement to be up to the important task they are meant to perform. Historically, these mechanisms have fallen short because of the capital markets’ necessary dependency on custody chains. Custody chains perform valuable functions but they also create a distance between the company and the end investor from which flows a significant risk of voting preferences and other important information not passing smoothly up and down the chain. Corporate governance is thus at risk of being distorted by process deficiencies. Changes to the operation of custody chains that were introduced by the EU’s flagship amended Shareholder Rights Directive II became operative in September 2020. This article is therefore among the first to draw on operational impact to assess the significance of these new measures. Experience has already demonstrated that while there have been some important advances, the regulatory changes are struggling on two levels: they have created new uncertainties within national laws; and they have failed to provide the necessary cross-border harmonization of key concepts. These are not issues that can be resolved effectively by technology or market workarounds on their own. There is a continuing need for legislative change to ensure that legal uncertainties do not act as a barrier to further technology-driven market standardization and innovation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Company Meetings; Corporate Actions; Corporate Governance; Custody Chains; Engagement; Regulatory Harmonization; Shareholder Rights; Technology,,"I am grateful to Pierre- Henri Conac, James Cunningham and Edwin De Pauw for their insightful comments and suggestions.

However, little is known about how such facilities are financed. This issue creates potential knowledge gaps, one of which this study aims to address. This study examines the key drivers for green building project financing in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an explanatory sequential design with an initial quantitative instrument phase, followed by a qualitative data collection phase. An extensive critical comparative review of the literature resulted in the identification of eight potential drivers. One hundred and twenty-seven questionnaire responses based upon these drivers from the Ghanaian construction industry were received. Data were coded with SPSS v22, analysed descriptively (mean, standard deviation and standard error) and via inferential analysis (One Way ANOVA and One-Sample t-Test). These data were then validated through semi-structured interviews with ten industry professionals within the Ghana Green Building Council. Data obtained from the semi-structured validation interviews were analysed through the side-by-side comparison of the qualitative data with the quantitative data. Findings: Though all eight drivers are important, the five key drivers for the Ghanian construction industry were identified as, in order of importance, “high return on investment”, “emerging business opportunity”, “ethical investment”, “conservation of resources” and “mandatory regulations, standards, and policies”. The interviewees agreed to and confirmed the importance of these identified drivers for green building project financing from validating the survey's key findings. Research limitations/implications: Key limitations of this study are the restrictions regarding the geographical location of the collected data (i.e. Kumasi and Accra); timing of the study and sample size (i.e. the COVID-19 pandemic making it difficult to obtain adequate data). Practical implications: Though this study was conducted in Ghana, its implications could be useful to researchers, policymakers, stakeholders and practitioners in wider sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, financial institutions can invest in green buildings to expand their green construction and mortgage finance products to build higher value and lower risk portfolios. The findings from this study can provide investors with the enhanced certainty needed to help guide and inform their investment decisions, i.e. what to invest in, and when, by how much and how a scheme being “green” may influence their rate of return. Also, for building developers, it will give them a clearer understanding of the business case for green buildings and how to differentiate themselves in the market to grow their businesses. Originality/value: This study's findings provide insights into an under-investigated topic in Ghana and offer new and additional information and insights to the current state-of-the-art on the factors that drive green building project financing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Drivers; Ghana; Green Buildings; Green Project Financing; Sustainability; Sustainable Or Green Construction; Buildings; Conservation; Construction; Construction Industry; Digital Storage; Earnings; Environmental Technology; Green Manufacturing; Project Management; Surveys; Conservation Of Resources; Construction Technologies; Design/methodology/approach; Geographical Locations; Green Building Council; Green Building Projects; Industry Professionals; Semi Structured Interviews; Investments,Buildings; Conservation; Construction; Construction industry; Digital storage; Earnings; Environmental technology; Green manufacturing; Project management; Surveys; Conservation of resources; Construction technologies; Design/methodology/approach; Geographical locations; Green Building Council; Green building projects; Industry professionals; Semi structured interviews; Investments,,"Addy, Michael Nii, Impediments to the development of the green building market in sub-Saharan Africa: the case of Ghana, Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 10, 2, pp. 193-207, (2020); Agyekum, Kofi, Barriers to the adoption of green certification of buildings: A thematic analysis of verbatim comments from built environment professionals, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 17, 5, pp. 1035-1055, (2019); Agyekum, Kofi, Obstacles to green building project financing: an empirical study in Ghana, International Journal of Construction Management, 22, 15, pp. 2922-2930, (2022); Agyekum, Kofi, Factors driving the adoption of green certification of buildings in Ghana, Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 9, 4, pp. 595-613, (2020); Agyekum, Kofi, The impact of COVID-19 on the construction industry in Ghana: the case of some selected firms, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 20, 1, pp. 222-244, (2022); Agyekum, Kofi, Factors limiting the adoption of hemp as an alternative sustainable material for green building delivery in Ghana, International Journal of Building Pathology and Adaptation, 40, 2, pp. 202-218, (2022); Akadiri, Peter Oluwole, Design of a sustainable building: A conceptual framework for implementing sustainability in the building sector, Buildings, 2, 2, pp. 126-152, (2012); Akotia, Julius, Towards the delivery of sustainable regeneration projects’ types in the UK: an exploration of the role and level of involvement of key practitioners, International Journal of Construction Management, 18, 5, pp. 375-384, (2018); Al-Sanad, Shaikha A., Awareness, Drivers, Actions, and Barriers of Sustainable Construction in Kuwait, Procedia Engineering, 118, pp. 969-983, (2015); Ampratwum, Godslove, A framework for the implementation of green certification of buildings in Ghana, International Journal of Construction Management, 21, 12, pp. 1263-1277, (2021)",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,09699988,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108976543,

Although relatively novel, the concept of CE has gained significant momentum worldwide. CE can potentially help to solve the problem of resource depletion and environmental degradation. However, measuring circularity remains a question and a challenge for various stakeholders. This work aimed to propose an assessment tool to measure the circularity of construction projects. Through a systematic literature review, existing circularity measurement methods, tools, and actions associated with circularity in the construction industry were reviewed. A list of critical circularity actions was identified. Kazakhstan was selected as an emerging economy country to validate the tool. A survey was conducted among professionals in the construction industry to determine the importance of every action and the legislative readiness of local laws to support those actions. The proposed tool (CAT2022) was tailored to measure the circularity degree of construction projects in the selected emerging economy country. As part of the proposed circularity measurement tool, the study also provided several assessments to demonstrate the criteria in the evaluation and their fulfillment of the actions concerning circularity. The results show that projects perform notably differently in terms of circularity depending on methods of construction, technologies implemented, company business model, energy and material efficiency practices. In line with the common assumption that projects certified by green building rating systems are more “circular” than others, our findings indicated that LEED-certified buildings and buildings implementing modular construction methods tend to receive high circularity scores. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Central Asia; Circular Economy; Circularity; Circularity Assessment Tool; Construction Industry; Sdg11; Sdg9; Industrial Economics; Life Cycle; Modular Construction; Assessment Tool; Assessment Tool Development; Central Asia; Circular Economy; Circularity; Circularity Assessment Tool; Construction Projects; Emerging Economies; Sdg11; Sdg9; Construction Industry,Industrial economics; Life cycle; Modular construction; Assessment tool; Assessment tool development; Central Asia; Circular economy; Circularity; Circularity assessment tool; Construction projects; Emerging economies; SDG11; SDG9; Construction industry,The authors acknowledge the financial support from Nazarbayev University Faculty Development Competitive Research Grant Program (FDCRGP ; Funder Project Reference: 280720FD1904 ).,"Abadi, Mohamed, Integrating circular economy and constructability research: An initial development of a lifecycle ""circularity"" assessment framework and indicators, pp. 516-525, (2020); Adams, Katherine Tebbatt, Circular economy in construction: Current awareness, challenges and enablers, Proceedings of Institution of Civil Engineers: Waste and Resource Management, 170, 1, pp. 15-24, (2017); Ajayabi, Atta, REBUILD: Regenerative Buildings and Construction systems for a Circular Economy, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 225, 1, (2019); Akanbi, Lukman A., Salvaging building materials in a circular economy: A BIM-based whole-life performance estimator, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 129, pp. 175-186, (2018); Akhanova, Gulzhanat, A framework of building sustainability assessment system for the commercial buildings in Kazakhstan, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 17, (2019); Akinade, Olugbenga O., Design for deconstruction using a circular economy approach: barriers and strategies for improvement, Production Planning and Control, 31, 10, pp. 829-840, (2020); Antwi-Afari, Prince, A review of the circularity gap in the construction industry through scientometric analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 298, (2021); Bao, Zhikang, Developing efficient circularity for construction and demolition waste management in fast emerging economies: Lessons learned from Shenzhen, China, Science of the Total Environment, 724, (2020); Benachio, Gabriel Luiz Fritz, Circular economy in the construction industry: A systematic literature review, Journal of Cleaner Production, 260, (2020); Modular Construction from Projects to Products, (2019)",,Elsevier Ltd,,09596526,,JCROE,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130533327,

Greek public hospitals in 2018 produced 9500 tons of hazardous healthcare wastes, and it is expected to reach 18,200 tons in 2025 and exceed 18,800 tons in 2030. In this paper, we investigated the factors that affect healthcare wastes. We obtained data from all Greek public hospitals and conducted a regression analysis, with the management cost of waste and the kilos of waste as the dependent variables, and a number of variables reflecting the characteristics of each hospital and its output as the independent variables. We applied and compared several models. Our study shows that healthcare wastes are affected by several individual-hospital characteristics, such as the number of beds, the type of the hospital, the services the hospital provides, the number of annual inpatients, the days of stay, the total number of surgeries, the existence of special units, and the total number of employees. Finally, our study presents two prediction models concerning the management costs and quantities of infectious waste for Greece’s public hospitals and proposes specific actions to reduce healthcare wastes and the respective costs, as well as to implement and adopt certain tools, in terms of sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Greece; Healthcare Waste; Medical Waste; Public Health; Sustainability In Healthcare; Waste Management; Hazardous Waste; Medical Waste Disposal; Climate Change; Health Care; Hospital Sector; Public Health; Public Sector; Solid Waste; Sustainability; Waste Management; Adult; Article; Dependent Variable; Employee; Greece; Health Care Cost; Hospital Patient; Hospital Waste; Human; Independent Variable; Infectious Waste; Prediction; Public Hospital; Hazardous Waste; Health Care Delivery; Waste Disposal; Delivery Of Health Care; Hazardous Waste; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Medical Waste Disposal; Public Sector; Waste Management","climate change; health care; hospital sector; public health; public sector; solid waste; sustainability; waste management; adult; article; dependent variable; employee; Greece; health care cost; hospital patient; hospital waste; human; independent variable; infectious waste; prediction; public hospital; hazardous waste; health care delivery; waste disposal; Delivery of Health Care; Hazardous Waste; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Medical Waste Disposal; Public Sector; Waste Management","This research was funded by the University of West Attica, Athens, Greece, within the framework of the Postgraduate Health and Social Care Management Program.","Sustainability Analytics and Modeling, (2021); Global Spending on Health 2020 Weathering the Storm, (2020); Proc Int Healthc Facil, (2021); Zhu, Qingyun, Lean six sigma and environmental sustainability: A hospital perspective, Supply Chain Forum, 19, 1, pp. 25-41, (2018); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2016); Hensher, Martin C., Incorporating environmental impacts into the economic evaluation of health care systems: Perspectives from ecological economics, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 154, (2020); Int J Biol Biomed, (2020); Health Care Without Harm, (2019); Our New Road Map for Zero Emissions Health Care; Razzaq, Asif, Dynamic and causality interrelationships from municipal solid waste recycling to economic growth, carbon emissions and energy efficiency using a novel bootstrapping autoregressive distributed lag, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 166, (2021)",,MDPI,,16604601; 16617827,,,36011449.0,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136711543,

In developing countries, SMEs tend to exhibit low adaptive capacities, influenced by their enabling environments. A holistic understanding of how their capacity to adapt is influenced by both the qualities of their enabling environments and their inherent characteristics is needed. This study contributes to this understanding by reviewing the current knowledge of adaptive capacity in SMEs and providing an analysis of the environment for enabling SMEs to adapt to flood risk in Sri Lanka. Data originates from the Building Businesses’ Climate Resilience project, implemented in Sri Lanka between 2018 and 2021. The study finds that deficiencies in Sri Lanka’s enabling environment mean SMEs are unable to attain the information and competencies that would allow them to adopt suitable adaptation strategies for managing flood risk. Simultaneously, the results show that their capacity to cope with the impacts of flood events is not adequately enhanced by the financial services and support available prior to, and in the aftermath of, extreme weather events. Accordingly, it is suggested that the national government play a greater role in enhancing the enabling environment for adaptation. With the support of other prominent actors in Sri Lanka’s enabling environment, they should seek to enhance access to post-disaster finance, the availability of affordable insurance products for uninsured SMEs, and the availability of interventions and resources that fill the information and capacity gaps that SMEs possess. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptive Capacity; Climate Change Adaptation; Developing Countries; Enabling Environment; Small Businesses; Adaptive Management; Developing World; Financial Services; Flood; Government; Knowledge; Private Sector; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Sri Lanka,adaptive management; developing world; financial services; flood; government; knowledge; private sector; small and medium-sized enterprise; Sri Lanka,The funding to conduct this research and write this study was covered using internal funding at UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre (formerly UNEP DTU Partnership).

We use qualitative sequential methodology, involving empiric analysis that provides coherence and viability for our study, but also quantitative methods, including Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), unit root tests and cointegration techniques. The results suggest the existence of a long run cointegrating relationship between growth and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in EU countries and the DOLS method indicates a statistically significant effect of economic growth on CO<inf>2</inf> emissions for both versions of estimators, revealing that on average, a 1% change in GDP leads to 0.072 change in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The study also exhibits that higher income levels lead to increased demand for environmental protection and underline the need for designing environmental policies, capable to reduce emissions during periods of economic growth. Moreover, we find that the status of economic growth does not automatically diminish climate vulnerability in EU countries, only the correct type of growth does, thus being necessary that EU policymakers be aware of the energy cost pressure and to achieve economic growth in relationship with appropriate tools in terms of climate risk management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Risk; Co2 Emissions; Cointegration Analysis; Economic Growth; Environmental Degradation,,"This work was supported by a grant of the “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iasi, within the Research Grants program, Grant UAIC, code GI-UAIC-2021–08 (Vatamanu).","Acaravci, Ali, On the relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions and economic growth in Europe, Energy, 35, 12, pp. 5412-5420, (2010); Al-Mulali, Usama, Factors affecting CO2 emission in the Middle East: A panel data analysis, Energy, 44, 1, pp. 564-569, (2012); Al-Mulali, Usama, Oil consumption, CO2 emission and economic growth in MENA countries, Energy, 36, 10, pp. 6165-6171, (2011); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Energy consumption, economic growth and CO 2 emissions in Middle East and North African countries, Energy Policy, 45, pp. 342-349, (2012); Aye, Goodness C., Effect of economic growth on CO2 emission in developing countries: Evidence from a dynamic panel threshold model, Cogent Economics and Finance, 5, 1, (2017); Azam, Anam, Analyzing the effect of natural gas, nuclear energy and renewable energy on GDP and carbon emissions: A multi-variate panel data analysis, Energy, 219, (2021); Azam, Muhammad, The impact of CO2 emissions on economic growth: evidence from selected higher CO2 emissions economies, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 23, 7, pp. 6376-6389, (2016); Bai, Zhidong, A new test of multivariate nonlinear causality, PLOS ONE, 13, 1, (2018); Bastola, Umesh, Relationships among energy consumption, pollution emission, and economic growth in Nepal, Energy, 80, pp. 254-262, (2015); Baz, Khan, Asymmetric impact of fossil fuel and renewable energy consumption on economic growth: A nonlinear technique, Energy, 226, (2021)",,Frontiers Media S.A.,,2296665X,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134919820,

Excessive emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are one of the main reasons for the problem. The more GHGs are released into the atmosphere, the more the sun's heat can be captured by those gases, leading to global warming and other ripple effects. Many countries and companies have begun to take steps to reduce their emissions. Carbon management is a method that enables them to control the release of GHGs. This report will focus on Canada's largest bank, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and examine the firm's carbon management practices towards achieving zero net emissions. This company is strongly involved with other companies' business through financing and investment as a financial institution, indicating that it has a responsibility for both its own carbon emissions and emissions by companies which it finances or invests. The firm's emissions mainly come from infrastructure, purchased electricity, business travel, the use of products, employee commuting, financing and investment. This company's strategy to be carbon neutral consists of the following main pillars: making operations more efficient, helping clients with the transition to net zero, and responsible financing and investment. This report evaluates the carbon management practice of the RBC, suggesting that it needs more implementation of plans and more detailed data collection and analysis regarding its emissions to achieve the goal of net zero. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Management; Corporate Sustainability; Esg; Net Zero; Royal Bank Of Canada; Banking; Business; Climate Change; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gas; Investment; Management Practice; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; Canada,banking; business; climate change; global warming; greenhouse gas; investment; management practice; strategic approach; sustainability; Canada,,"Environmental Social Governance Performance Data Summary, (2020); Leed Commercial Buildings; Climate Change 2007 the Physical Science Basis, (2007); Greenhouse Gas Protocol, (2015); Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures Status Report, (2019); Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, (2022); Moving into the Mainstream Green Buildings and Leed, (2011); Electric Vehicle Ev Car Loans; Climate Blueprint, (2019); Environment Social and Governance Esg Performance Report Public Accountability Statement 2018, (2019)",,University of California Press,,24739510,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134378625,

Our article expands knowledge in this field by analyzing how investor impact is implemented in the ethical investment policies of 45 providers of publicly traded, socially responsible funds. Based on a typological content analysis, we first develop an impact-focused category system, which in the second step is used to distinguish three types of fund providers: ESG hermits, ESG ambassadors and ESG evangelists. Our results suggest that socially responsible fund providers with a stronger impact orientation, such as ESG evangelists, also employ strategies that are more likely to achieve investor impact. In contrast, fund providers with a weaker impact orientation, such as ESG hermits, focus more on purity aspects and therefore tend to utilize strategies that defend the purity claim but also show a weaker investor impact. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Investor Impact; Shareholder Engagement; Socially Responsible Investments; Sri; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Investing; Typological Content Analysis,,Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the funding programme Open Access Publishing.

Based on data collected from 220 banks in 16 Sub-Saharan Africa countries over the 2007–2018 period (i.e., making over 2027 bank-year observations), the findings of the study are as follows: Firstly, the study finds that corporate governance mechanisms have positive impact on sustainable decisions, as captured by environmental disclosures and sustainable banking initiatives. Secondly, the study finds that sustainable banking initiatives improve the financial performance of banks in the Sub-Saharan African countries. Finally, the study detects that the relationship between sustainable banking initiatives and financial performance is significantly moderated by corporate governance mechanisms, revealing that the sustainability-for-performance sensitivity metric is mainly positive, and improves in banks with quality corporate governance mechanisms. This indicates that the sustainability-for-performance sensitivity is contingent on the quality of the bank's corporate governance structures. The findings have key implications for banking practitioners, environmental activists, regulators and policymakers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Governance; Environmental Protection Management; Financial Performance; Stakeholder Engagement; Sustainable Banking Initiatives; Sustainable Development; Banking; Corporate Strategy; Environmental Economics; Environmental Protection; Financial System; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sub-saharan Africa,banking; corporate strategy; environmental economics; environmental protection; financial system; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development; Sub-Saharan Africa,,"undefined, (2021); Adu, Douglas Akwasi, Executive compensation, environmental performance, and sustainable banking: The moderating effect of governance mechanisms, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 4, pp. 1439-1463, (2022); Adu, Douglas Akwasi, Executive compensation and sustainable business practices: The moderating role of sustainability-based compensation, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 3, pp. 698-736, (2022); Apergis, Nicholas, FINANCIAL EXPERTS ON THE BOARD: DOES IT MATTER FOR THE PROFITABILITY AND RISK OF THE U.K. BANKING INDUSTRY?, Journal of Financial Research, 42, 2, pp. 243-270, (2019); Arellano, Manuel, Some tests of specification for panel data:monte carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Aslam, Ejaz, A comparative analysis of the performance of Islamic and conventional banks: Does corporate governance matter?, International Journal of Business Excellence, 24, 1, pp. 53-67, (2021); Baboukardos, Diogenis, The valuation relevance of environmental performance revisited: The moderating role of environmental provisions, British Accounting Review, 50, 1, pp. 32-47, (2018); Barako, Dulacha Galgallo, Corporate social reporting and board representation: Evidence from the Kenyan banking sector, Journal of Management and Governance, 12, 4, pp. 309-324, (2008); Barnett, Michael L., Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 11, pp. 1101-1122, (2006); Beattie, Vivien A., A methodology for analysing and evaluating narratives in annual reports: A comprehensive descriptive profile and metrics for disclosure quality attributes, Accounting Forum, 28, 3, pp. 205-236, (2004)",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,09644733; 10990836,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125925750,

It extends this work to consider in more detail the channels through which climate risks may impact property performance and the implications for the valuation community. Findings: Recent empirical studies have identified more instances where pricing is reflecting both current and anticipated climate risks. Market valuations cannot properly incorporate climate risk without clear evidence that it is priced by market participants, but valuers can advise clients on the potential for future impacts. Research limitations/implications: While inferences can be made from studies of residential real estate, more research on commercial real estate pricing and climate risk is required to assist valuers and their clients, as well as other stakeholders in the real estate market. Practical implications: Differences between a Market Value and an Investment Value context are considered, and how valuers could and should account for climate risk in each setting is discussed with reference to existing professional standards and guidance.

Design/methodology/approach: The research examines the land planning responses within a select local government authority (“LGA”) area following four significant weather events, in order to identify any changes made, and the impact on future development proposals. The LGA selected is the Central Coast Council, which is a coastal LGA in the Australian State of New South Wales. The research engaged with the publicly accessible records available on the Central Coast Council, Australian Bureau of Meteorology and other websites; and extant literature. Findings: The research reveals that some adjustments were made by the Central Coast Council, and or the State government, to relevant laws, policies and processes following these events. These changes, however, tended to focus on imposing additional requirements on future development applications, rather than on requiring changes to current structures, or prohibiting further development works. Research limitations/implications: The research has three limitations: (1) land law in Australia varies, as each State and Territory, and LGA, has specific laws, policies and processes; (2) as laws and policies are subject to change, it was necessary to select points in time at which to engage with those laws and processes; and (3) COVID-19's impact on domestic Australian travel [the authors could not travel interstate] meant only documents available on the Internet were considered, however, not all documents relating to development; or changes to laws and processes were easily accessible online. As the research focussed on one case study area, this may limit the applicability of the results to other areas. However, as extreme events are international, the related issues are a concern in all areas. Practical implications: This research confirms the results of other extant research, which observed that some risks cannot be properly mitigated, such that any development in an at-risk area remains at risk. It also identifies that more current, accurate and publicly accessible data are required to enable investors to more easily and accurately identify all risks affecting a property. Originality/value: The research provides a snapshot of one LGA's response to the physical risks arising from climate change events. As investors and other organisations integrate and build up their analysis of climate risks to their portfolios and organisations, governments become more aware of the long-term effects of climate change and consistently with extant research; this research indicates that a greater awareness is required of current risks and action to manage the short-term effects and cost challenges, in addition to the long-term adaptation requirements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Australia; Climate Change Risk; Coastal; New South Wales; Sea Level Rise; Valuation,,The authors acknowledge the funding support provided by the QUT Law Seed Funding (2020) program; and the research assistance provided by Anne Overell.,"2011 Census Quickstats, (2025); Australian Historical Population Statistics, (2008); Australian Historical Population Statistics, (2019); Building Approvals Australia, (2021); Building Approvals by Sa2 and Above July 2016 to June 2021 Central Coast, (2021); Region Summary Central Coast Sa4102, (2021); Regional Population 2019 20, (2021); Local Government Law Journal, (2014); Bell-James, Justine, Compliance with statutory directives and the negligence liability of public authorities: Climate change and coastal development, Environmental and Planning Law Journal, 34, 5, pp. 398-417, (2017); Beltrán, Allan, Is Flood Risk Capitalised Into Property Values?, Ecological Economics, 146, pp. 668-685, (2018)",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,1463578X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124901981,

Ecosystem services are resources and benefits that modern humanity can receivfrom the nature. It is the material benefit from abiogenic and biogenic components of various natural ecosystems. Therwere not large-scale studies according of evaluation ecosystem services in the Ukrainian water area of the Black Sebefore, it is the actual environmental and socio-economic problem. Review of previous publications. The main approach to evaluating the state of ecosystems in the EU countriebased on the choice of load indicators on the ecosystems and their mapping. Multi-level approach implies the next stepsdetection and evaluation of services (indicators, borders, quantitative assessment); calculations and a demonstration ovalue (assessment in physical units and money equivalent); court fixation and solutions (tools-subsidies, taxes, paymentfor ecosystem services, etc.). Purpose. The man goal of the paper is analysis and estimation of modern state of ecosystem services, methods anperspectives of their using. Methods. The methodological basis of the study is the critical analysis of existing approaches to the assessment oecosystem services of marine and coastal ecosystems. During the preparing of the paper published data had been used, awell as the materials of personal research on various aspects of the evaluation of ecosystem services of the Northwesterpart of the Black Sea. Results. Marine and coastal ecosystems play a critical role in providing key services such as food supply, sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, waste management, biological regulation and the provision of habitat for hydrobiontsHowever, along with other ecosystems, today they are under serious anthropogenic pressure. Some types of anthropogeniactivities have a very negative effect to the condition of natural ecosystems and to receive of their services. The ecosystems of the Northwestern part of the Black Sea are the living place of numerous organisms. These ecosystems consist osupporting services. Important regulatory services provide wetlands protected by the Ramsar Convention. The most intense cycle of nutrient substances occurs in the river’s mouth areas. The marine environment absorbs, disinfects anprocesses all sorts of waste production and consumption. Conclusions. Take into account of the limited information of the of ecosystem services under the Northwestern part of the Black Sea, the first task is to determine the needs of local populations for these services, collection and generalization of information about their condition, coordination of their assessment methods for the region and the evaluation itself. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ecosystem Services; Ecosystems; Northwestern Part Of The Black Sea,,,"Ecosystems and Human Well Being Synthesis, (2005); Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services an Eu Ecosystem Assessment, (2020); Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services an Analytical Framework for Ecosystem Condition, (2018); Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity Mainstreaming the Economics of Nature A Synthesis of the Approach Conclusions and Recommendations of Teeb, (2010); Bloom or Bust A Document of the Unep Fi Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Work Stream Besw, (2008); Costanza, Robert, The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, Nature, 387, 6630, pp. 253-260, (1997); Mace, Georgina M., Biodiversity and ecosystem services: A multilayered relationship, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 27, 1, pp. 19-26, (2012); Eko Potentsial, (2019); Nicholson, Emily, Making robust policy decisions using global biodiversity indicators, PLOS ONE, 7, 7, (2012); Ressurreição, Adriana M., Different cultures, different values: The role of cultural variation in public's WTP for marine species conservation, Biological Conservation, 145, 1, pp. 148-159, (2012)",,V N Karazin Kharkiv National University,,24113913; 24107360,,,,Ukrainian,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213685071,

Increasingly, climate litigation brought against governments and corporations utilizes international human rights, environmental and climate laws and policies to seek accountability for climate-destructive and health-harming actions. The health impacts of climate change make litigation an important means of pursuing justice and strategically challenging legal systems. Yet there is scant documentation in the literature of the role that public health has played in climate litigation and the legal weight public health narratives are given in such contexts. Therefore, we assessed to what extent courts of law have used public health harm in legal adjudication and sought to provide practical recommendations to address barriers to positioning legal arguments in public health-centric frames. Methods We reviewed legal databases to identify all publicly reported, documented, cases of climate litigation filed in any country or jurisdiction between 1990 and September 2020. For the 1641 cases identified, we quantified the frequency of cases where health concerns were explicitly or implicitly raised. Findings Case numbers are trending upwards, notably in high income countries. Resolution remains pending in over half of cases as the majority were initiated in the past three years. Cases were primarily based in climate and human rights law and brought by a wide range of groups and individuals predominantly against governments. About half of the decided cases found in favour for the plaintiffs. Based on this, we selected the 65 cases that were directly linked to public health. We found economic forces and pricing of health risks play a key role, as courts are challenged by litigants to adjudicate on the responsibility for health impacts. Conclusions While courts of law are receptive to public health science, significant legal reform is needed to enhance leveraging of public health evidence in legal judgements of climate litigation cases. The integration of a public health mandate into a new eco-centric legal paradigm will optimize its potential to promote human well-being—the core objective underpinning both international law, human rights, and public health.

Sustainability is an issue that is becoming increasingly important among to the various stakeholders in the insurance industry. It is a complex concept that has many different dimensions that can be included in these regulations, allowing for a more sustainable solvency. The paper uses a qualitative model previously designed and tested in the literature to analyse the solvency regulations of the European Union, United States of America, China, Australia, Brazil and South Africa and determine their level of convergence. It also links the criteria set out in these models to the dimensions of sustainability in order to determine the degree of sus-tainability of solvency systems and the questions that regulators will need to consider in the near future in order to achieve more sustainable solvency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Capital Requirements; Insurance Supervision; Insurance Sustainability; Risk Management; Solvency; Insurance Industry; Qualitative Analysis; Risk Assessment; Stakeholder; Australia; Brazil; China; South Africa; United States,insurance industry; qualitative analysis; risk assessment; stakeholder; Australia; Brazil; China; South Africa; United States,Acknowledgements: The authors acknowledge support from the Polibienestar Research Institute.

This paper identifies and evaluates climate risk management practices among this under-researched investor group in their capacity to address fundamental behavioural obstacles to low-carbon investment. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes an inductive approach to document analysis, applying content and thematic analysis to the annual disclosures of the 28 largest UK asset managers (by assets under management), including the investment management arms of insurance and pension companies. Findings: The main takeaway from this research is that today’s climate risk management strategies hold potential to effectively address traditionally climate risk-averse investor behaviour and investment processes in the UK asset management context. However, this research finds that the use of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment strategies to mitigate climate risks is a “grey area” in which climate risk management practices are undefined within broad sustainability and responsible investment agendas. In doing so, this paper invites further research into the extent to which climate risks are considered in ESG investment. Originality/value: This paper contributes to research in sustainable finance and behavioural finance, by identifying the latest climate risk management techniques used among UK-headquartered asset managers and uniquely evaluating these in their capacity to address barriers to low-carbon investment arising from organisational behaviours and processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Asset Management; Behavioural Finance; Climate Investment; Climate Risk Disclosure; Climate Risk Management; Sustainable Finance; Climate Change; Environmental Economics; Investment; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; United Kingdom,climate change; environmental economics; investment; strategic approach; sustainability; United Kingdom,,"Ameli, Nadia, Climate finance and disclosure for institutional investors: why transparency is not enough, Climatic Change, 160, 4, pp. 565-589, (2020); Battiston, Stefano, A climate stress-test of the financial system, Nature Climate Change, 7, 4, pp. 283-288, (2017); Green Finance Strategy Transforming Finance for A Greener Future, (2019); Caldecott, Ben, Introduction to special issue: stranded assets and the environment, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 7, 1, pp. 1-13, (2017); Stranded Assets in Agriculture Protecting Value from Environment Related Risks, (2013); Cullen, Jay, After 'HLEG': EU Banks, Climate Change Abatement and the Precautionary Principle, Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies, 20, pp. 61-87, (2018); Elkington, John, Towards the Sustainable Corporation: Win-Win-Win Business Strategies for Sustainable Development, California Management Review, 36, 2, pp. 90-100, (1994); Journal of Finance, (1970); Climate Related Corporate Reporting Where to Next, (2019); Lab Project Report Risk and Viability Reporting Www Document, (2017)",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,17568692,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129762146,

Against this background, we analyze the role of insurers, especially in the property and casualty areas, in addressing the environmental and climate risk challenges and developing a truly sustainable, environmentally friendly business model— green insurance. Building on the Principles of Sustainable Insurance set by the United Nations, we develop a comprehensive roadmap along the insurance value chain for executive management to design their company’s sustainability efforts, with special focus on property and casualty. The roadmap indicates actions to be taken as well as metrics to be managed in product development, marketing and sales, risk management and underwriting and operations and claims management towards green insurance. The existing products, risk appetite and operational processes must be reviewed to support sustainability goals and include the full portfolio of activities, including claims.

In order to function on the market and develop, companies must adhere to the principles of sustainable development. In this context, the interest of companies in the implementation and application of ESG strategies is growing. In the long-term perspective, the use of this type of strategy is to generate an increase in the company’s value. This value is of interest to the company’s stakeholders, who may use the information about the company’s value, e.g., in terms of its management or investment. The aim of the article is to examine the relationship between the company’s value and its fundamental strength. The analysis covers companies from the energy sector (listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange) that declare the use of ESG practices. The time range of the research covers the years 2013–2020. For the purpose of the study, selected statistical measures and the Fundamental Power Index (FPI) were used. This indicator synthetically evaluates all areas of the company’s operations. The results of the research show that the value of the company is not influenced by its fundamental strength. Therefore, the investors do not reduce the company’s value in the light of information on its fundamental strength.

One way to consider the multidimensionality of sustainable agriculture is to refer to indicators, more precisely, to agri-environmental indicators (AEIs). This study provides a comparative overview of the 28 AEIs of the European Union (EU) and those of the OECD and FAO, additionally revealing how these 28 indicators are reflected in the literature regarding agri-environmental indicators. Furthermore, since much of human behavior is influenced by perceptions, it was critical to reveal the stakeholders’ assessment of the 28 AEIs based on four criteria (“Availability”, “Relevance”, “Target-oriented”, and “Operational simplicity”). The stakeholders’ opinions of the 28 AEIs were assessed using the evaluation matrix.

The research is empirical and explanatory, using qualitative strategy and the following methods: observation, a case study and a comparative method, for a period of ten years (2011–2020). The main findings of the research indicate four distinct categories of factors that could predict the capacity building for the Green Deal’s implementation: cultural, political, economic and social; as well as a differ-entiation of the Green Deal’s implementation in different stages at the EU level: industrialized Member States from the west and north, Member States from the south and north (Baltic states), and Member States from the central and south-east. The elaboration of national and regional plans for implementation and regional cooperation will provide suitable solutions, supported by the recovery and resilience funds. The research reveals that the prognosis for the Green Deal’s implementation in all of the investigated Member States is negative. The limitation of the research consists in its explanatory nature, which inhibits the ability to make definite conclusions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Action; Coordina-tion; Green Deal; Regional Cooperation; Sustainable Development; Capacity Building; European Union; Green Economy; Implementation Process; Czech Republic; Eastern Europe; Hungary; Poland [central Europe]; Romania; Slovakia,capacity building; European Union; green economy; implementation process; Czech Republic; Eastern Europe; Hungary; Poland [Central Europe]; Romania; Slovakia,,"Department of Economic and Social Affairs; Delivering on the Un S Sustainable Development Goals A Comprehensive Approach, (2020); Lets Us Make Europe A Safe Place for Environmental Human Rights Defenders; undefined; A European Strategy for Plastics in A Circular Economy; Ciot, Melania Gabriela, On european green deal and sustainable development policy (The case of romania), Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 21, (2021); A European Green Deal; European Green Deal Towards A Resilient and Sustainable Post Pandemic Recovery, (2021); Climate Tango Principles for Integrating Physical and Transition Climate Risk Assessment with Sectoral Examples, (2022); Complex Link Between Climate Change and Conflict, (2019)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127596918,

Recent Findings: Investor-related activity related to improving population diets is building, with several recent initiatives aiming to accelerate achievement of global nutrition goals. There is increasing civil society and investor activism focused on leveraging investor influence to improve nutrition-related food company actions. There are multiple sustainability-related reporting standards; however, few include comprehensive nutrition-related metrics. Summary: There is increasing interest from institutional investors in addressing nutrition-related issues; however, investor activity in the area is piece-meal. There is a need for further integration of nutrition within current reporting frameworks. Methodological alignment across the increasing number of food industry accountability initiatives would likely help galvanise increased investor action. Some jurisdictions are introducing relevant mandatory reporting requirements, which are likely to play a key role in enhancing transparency by the food industry and financial institutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Nutrition; Obesity Prevention; Responsible Investment; Sustainable Finance; Decision Making; European Union; Finance; Follow Up; Food Industry; Government; Health Care Policy; Human; Investment; Malnutrition; Nutrition; Obesity; Review; Stakeholder Engagement; United Nations; Diet; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Status; Diet; Food Industry; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Status; Obesity,decision making; European Union; finance; follow up; food industry; government; health care policy; human; investment; malnutrition; nutrition; obesity; Review; stakeholder engagement; United Nations; diet; nutrition policy; nutritional status; Diet; Food Industry; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Status; Obesity,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

Ensuring that the prices of assets, including residential property, reflect climate risks is essential in averting the systemic risk climate change poses to financial stability. By undertaking a case study of a major Australian bank through interviews and focus groups with twenty-six participants, we identify factors influencing climate-related decisions affecting home loans and draw together a framework of barriers and enablers building on prior literature. The framework's six categories are economic market failure, economic non-market failure, political-institutional, socio-cultural, behavioural and organisational, with more specific factors within each category. Interdependencies and relationships between factors mean they cannot be perceived or addressed in isolation. Further theorising of the stages of decision-making within the case bank reflect a need for proactive, comprehensive action embedded in core value creating processes and internal governance, that interact with and are deeply connected to the broader society and environment in which the bank operates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Barriers; Barriers Frameworks; Climate Risk; Enablers; Political-institutional; Socio-cultural; Commerce; Costs; Decision Making; Barrier; Barrier Framework; Case-studies; Climate Risk; Enabler; Home Loans; Market Failures; Political-institutional; Retail Banks; Socio-cultural; Climate Change,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Barrier; Barrier framework; Case-studies; Climate risk; Enabler; Home loans; Market failures; Political-institutional; Retail banks; Socio-cultural; Climate change,"This paper acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora nation whose lands this was written on.

Integrating climate scenarios into an asset valuation model provides useful and specific insights for risk management, but there is a lack of academic and market tools that effectively address this need. The critical barrier is that climate-related risks (physical and transition) are typically indirect variables in the cash flow calculation, and they should be computed based on the direct variables such as revenue, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and financing costs. The implementation of this framework shows how to delineate climate-related risks that are asset-specific and transforms them into financial risks. Using cash flow simulation and scenario analysis, it estimates an energy infrastructure asset's probability of default due to climate-related risks and the size and timing of the losses for any given default. To demonstrate the framework's application, we simulate the price climate-related risks of a utility-scale electricity generation facility powered by natural gas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cash Flow Modelling; Climate Resilience; Climate Risk Assessment; Energy Infrastructure Investment; Financial Impact Assessment; Project Finance; Scenario Analysis; Stranded Assets; Climate Models; Economics; Investments; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Risk Perception; Cash Flow Models; Climate Resilience; Climate Risk Assessment; Energy Infrastructure Investment; Energy Infrastructures; Financial Impact Assessment; Financial Impacts; Impact Assessments; Infrastructure Investment; Project Finance; Risks Assessments; Scenarios Analysis; Stranded Asset; Costs,Climate models; Economics; Investments; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Cash flow models; Climate resilience; Climate risk assessment; Energy infrastructure investment; Energy infrastructures; Financial impact assessment; Financial impacts; Impact assessments; Infrastructure investment; Project finance; Risks assessments; Scenarios analysis; Stranded asset; Costs,"The authors would like to thank Martin Fischer, Michael Lepech, Ashby Monk, and Andrew Peterman for helpful comments and suggestions.

Profits are a means to an end, not an end in itself. The ability of companies to innovate, scale and invest provides them with a powerful base for positive change. But companies are also criticized for not contributing sufficiently to society’s grand challenges. An increasingly VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world creates serious governance gaps that not only require new ways of regulation, but also new ways of doing business. Can companies effectively contribute to sustainable development and confront society’s systemic challenges? Arguably the most important frame to drive this ambition was introduced and unanimously adopted in 2015: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDG-agenda not only defines a holistic set of global goals and targets, but also foundational principles to guide meaningful action to their achievement by 2030. Multinational companies have signed up to the SDGs as the world’s long-term business plan. Realizing the SDGs provides a yearly $12 trillion investment and growth opportunity, while creating hundreds of millions of jobs in the process. But progress is too slow – witnessing society’s inability to deal with pressing human, ecological, economic and health crises – whilst the vast potential for societal value creation remains underutilized. This book provides a timely account of the systemic, strategic and operational challenges that need to be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of corporate involvement in society, by using the SDGs as the leading principles-based framework for actionable, powerful and transformative change. Principles of Sustainable Business is written for graduate and postgraduate (executive) students, policymakers and business professionals who want to understand the complex challenges of global sustainability. It shows how companies can design and implement SDG-relevant strategies at three levels: the macro level, to assess whether the SDGs present wicked problems or opportunities; the micro level, to develop and operationalize innovative business models, design new business cases and navigate organizational transition trajectories; and the meso level, to develop fit-for-purpose cross-sector partnering strategies. Principles of Sustainable Business presents innovative tools embedded in a coherent sequence of analytical frameworks that can be applied in courses for students, be put into practice by business professionals and used by action researchers to help companies contribute to the Decade of Action. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Mainstreaming Sustainable Business 20 Years Business Society Management 20 Years Impact Smo and Department of Business Society Management Smo 2018 3, (2018); Better World, (2017); Shared Responsibility Global Solidarity Responding to the Socio Economic Impacts of Covid 19, (2020); Report of the Secretary General on the Situation in East Timor, (1999); Sustainable Development Goals, (2018); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2025); United Nations Global Compact Accenture Strategy Ceo Study on Sustainability, (2019); United Nations Global Compact Accenture Strategy Ceo Study, (2016); Wbcsd, (2018); National Bureau of Economic Research, (2017)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9780367565589; 9781000711455,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178575879,

In recognition of this threat, global leaders created an international regime designed to prevent further dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate. Since its inception, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has recognized that achieving this goal will require substantial global resources. While contributions from countries will comprise the bulk of international funding, public resources alone are insufficient to meet the investment requirements necessary to accomplish climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. World leaders have called on the private sector to fill this gap. This Article explores how sustainability reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) can encourage greater contribution from the private sector to meet international climate change goals. The GRI and other reporting initiatives have substantially increased access to sustainability and climate-related investment information. Yet access to information has not achieved a meaningful increase in private sector investment. Indeed, too much information may be part of the problem. Major obstacles such as a lack of standardized reporting requirements and lack of transparency inhibit higher levels of private sector involvement. This Article identifies problems as they relate to the GRI and how sustainability reporting frameworks can promote greater contribution from the private sector to meet international climate change goals by addressing investor concerns and filling current data gaps. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Building the Post 2015 Business Engagement Architecture, (2013); World Investment Report 2021, (2021); undefined, (2019); Countries Reach Historic Agreement to Generate Financing for New Sustainable Development Agenda; Introduction to Climate Finance; World Investment Report 2014 Investing in the Sdgs an Action Plan at 137, (2014); undefined; U N Conf on Trade Dev Sdg Investment Trends Monitor, (2019); Id; Enabling Private Investment in Climate Adaptation and Resilience Current Status Barriers to Investment and Blueprint for Action, (2025)",,Denver University Law Review,,24696471; 24696463,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173980308,

Based on the analysis of the institutional infrastructure of green financing that has developed in the world economy as well as the use of green bonds, this chapter shows the possibilities and directions of the development of green financing for the implementation of projects undertaken by the Russian Federation in the Arctic zone. The identified institutions and structures of the Russian system of green financing allow us to conclude that it is incomplete and there is a weak relationship between the organizations involved in green financing in the Arctic. The necessity of using the State program “Socio-economic development of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation until 2025,” along with budget financing, is justified the capital of private investors with the help of green bonds. The modest experience of Russian companies in placing green bonds showed the need to improve the verification system and the system of disclosure of nonfinancial information of an environmental nature of companies implementing projects with an environmental component. More complete information about the green characteristics of the projects and about the purposes of using the funds received from the placement of bonds will become prerequisites for attracting investments from the international capital market to the Arctic. In addition, improving the system of stimulating the placement of green bonds will increase the interest of Russian investors to use this tool more widely to finance green projects in the Arctic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Capital Market; Environmental Projects; Green Bonds; Green Financing; The Arctic,,,"Agliardi, Elettra, Financing environmentally-sustainable projects with green bonds, Environment and Development Economics, 24, 6, pp. 608-623, (2019); Economics and Management, (2019); Barua, Suborna, Sustainable financing practices through green bonds: What affects the funding size?, Business Strategy and the Environment, 28, 6, pp. 1131-1147, (2019); New Economics Foundation, (2007); Russia Green Finance Unlocking Opportunities for Green Investments, (2018); Tcfd Climate Change Financial Disclosure Working Group, (2020); Forbes, (2017); Gianfrate, Gianfranco, The green advantage: Exploring the convenience of issuing green bonds, Journal of Cleaner Production, 219, pp. 127-135, (2019); Goosse, Hugues, Quantifying climate feedbacks in polar regions, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Currency Regulation Currency Control, (2017)",,Springer Nature,,,9789811692499; 9789811692505,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173354746,

In particular, the works on determining the state of fulfillmentof banks’ obligations under the core principles of sustainable banking, identifyingthe contribution of banks and other financial institutions in promoting sustainablechange in the economy, and ensuring the achievement of Sustainable DevelopmentGoals by 2030 are analyzed. A study of the state of energy consumption in Ukraine,trends in the market of renewable energy sources, and the implementation of biomassto-energy projects was conducted. Key barriers to the implementation of such projectshave been identified, including the need to establish effective financial support mechanisms,namely bank lending policies. The contribution of the banking sector in emergingmarkets to the promotion of sustainable transformation and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals has been studied. The concept of the bank’s environmental policy in the field of resource allocation tofoster sustainable economic development is formed, which is based on two key structuralcomponents. The first involves managing environmental risks in the field of lending,in particular, which would regulate the participation of banks in the implementationof environmental security measures by assessing their loan portfolio, analyzing all projectssubject to lending for compliance with environmental safety and environmentalstandards, and refusal in consideration of loan applications to projects that pose a potentialthreat to the environment, and enterprises engaged in environmentally hazardousactivities. The second determines the development of “green finance” programs asa structural component of the environmental management system of banks, in particular,for lending to various profitable environmental projects to increase the effectivenessof banks’ participation in their financing, as well as opportunities for banks to participatein investing non-profit territorial communities, cities in order to increase the environmentalresponsibility of banks and their participation in the sustainable development ofthe region in particular and the country in general. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bank’s Environmentalpolicy; Energy Strategy Of Ukraine; Environmental Risk Management; Principles Of Responsible Banking; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Banking; Sustainable Economic Development; “green Finance” Programs,,,"undefined, (2011); Sotsialna Vidpovidalnistbankivskoho Sektoru Ukraiiny Social Responsibility Ofthe Banking Sector of Ukraine, (2014); Dnipro State Agrarian and Economicuniversity, (2016); Aracil, Elisa, Sustainable banking: A literature review and integrative framework, Finance Research Letters, 42, (2021); Úbeda, Fernando, How sustainable banking fosters the SDG 10 in weak institutional environments, Journal of Business Research, 146, pp. 277-287, (2022); Úbeda, Fernando, Do formal and informal institutions shape the influence of sustainable banking on financial development?, Finance Research Letters, 46, (2022); Kumar, Satish, Past, present, and future of sustainable finance: insights from big data analytics through machine learning of scholarly research, Annals of Operations Research, 345, 2, pp. 1061-1104, (2025); Li, Wei'an, Green governance structure, ownership characteristics, and corporate financing constraints, Journal of Cleaner Production, 260, (2020); How are Banksdoing on Sustainable Finance Commitments Notgood Enough, (2019); Un Environment Programme Finance Initiative",,Fintech Aliance LLC,,23064994; 23108770,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165574249,

The main results of the study are the streamlining of approaches to the systematics of ecological, social, and managerial risks, proposals for creating an additional mechanism for managing such risks, and determining the key role of the supervisory authority in encouraging banks to transform. Ukrainian banks are still at the beginning of the path to a full-fledged business model based on the principles of sustainable finance. The culture of risk management requires unification and a free transfer of experience between banks and supervision in the dissemination of good practice. There is no need to create a new organizational structure within the bank, but it is enough to enrich all three lines of risk protection with new functions and responsibilities. Today, too much attention is paid by the banking community, regulators and analysts to climate risks. The least developed in terms of methodology remains the component of corporate governance, as a result of which it is perceived as artificially attached to environmental and social aspects. Integration of ESG in banks' strategies and investment policies means an offering of ESG-related products (sustainable, green, and social bonds, green project finance etc.) for the markets. There is a danger of withdrawing debt capital from industries that are recognized as ""dirty"", but where the owners of the business are trying to really clean them up by modernizing technologies. Therefore, a practical solution for a modern bank is not simply a refusal to finance certain sectors of the economy, but to a greater extent a reorientation to projects that involve energy saving and energy efficiency, reducing emissions of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, declining consumption of water and other resources. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bank Supervision; Banking; Esg Risks; Sustainable Finance,,"Assignment of “liability risks”, as proposed by Carney, M.

Liability risk is materialized in losses due to litigations and enforcement measures, sanctions by courts, regulators, with damage to the reputation of both the investment project and investors/lenders involved, as well as with worsening profitability and access to new funding for both parties. Sustainable investors obviously reject the project itself and the recipient of funds, otherwise, further engagement will damage their reputation in the market and incompliance to eligibility criteria for funding. MinterEllison experts suggest, that legal action can act as both a driver of adaptation to physical climate-related risks and as a consequence of maladaptation or a failure to adapt. It is worth noting, that the most common position at present is the inclusion of liability risks in the broader category of ""transition risks"", as recommended, in particular, by European Central Bank (2020) [10]; European Banking Authority (2020) [11; 12 ]; European Systemic Risk Board (2020) [ 12].","European Commission, (2007); Climate Related Financial Risks A Survey on Current Initiatives, (2020); Principles for the Effective Management and Supervision of Climate Related Financial Risks, (2022); Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon Climate Change and Financial Stability, (2015); Development of Tools and Mechanisms for the Integration of Esg Factors into the Eu Banking Prudential Framework and into Banks Business Strategies and Investment Policies, (2021); Eba Publishes Binding Standards on Pillar 3 Disclosures on Esg Risks, (2021); Eba Report on Management and Supervision of Esg Risks for Credit Institutions and Investment Firms, (2021); Applying Enterprise Risk Management to Environmental Social and Governance Related Risks, (2018); Kpmg, (2021); Guide on Climate Related and Environmental Risks, (2020)",,Fintech Aliance LLC,,23064994; 23108770,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165479993,

It expands our financial value framework, heretofore built around risk and time, by factoring in space, as an analytical dimension and our physical context. The proposed principle and metrics entrench our responsibility for space impact into our value equations, making finance inherently sustainable and acting as a theoretical bridge between core finance theory and the growing field of sustainable finance or ESG integration. The book offers a novel approach to value design, measurement, and creation, discussing the theoretical, mathematical, institutional, technological and data elements of the transformation. The Space Value of Money principle and metrics offer us the opportunity to adjust our financial value framework and transform human productivity in line with our sustainability targets. They also enable the design and engineering of the financial instruments that can help us address our evolutionary challenges/investment, like the transition to Net Zero. “Every once in a while, a book comes along that makes a fundamental contribution that is both profound and practical. A book that every member of the National Space Council, including the NASA Administrator and the Space Force chief of space operations should read. The Space Value of Money will be of interest to ESG and impact investors, government regulators, financial theorists, and outer space enthusiasts.” —Lt Col Peter Garretson, Senior Fellow in Defense Studies at the American Foreign Policy Council “No doubt, the pressing environmental challenges we face make the concept of the space impact of investments even more compelling.” —Dr. Pascal Blanqué, Chairman of Amundi Institute, Former Group CIO of Amundi Asset Management “The Space Value of Money brings much needed conceptual rigour, whilst further advocating the case for a new paradigm shift in financial valuation. This work gives us the lasting frameworks that aggregate impact across all spatial dimensions.

Lastly, it examines the effects of Chinese and American banks’ discursively constructed CSR images on capital markets, with an inter-disciplinary approach of linguistics, management, and economics. Theoretically, this book contributes to the development of institutional identity’s cross-disciplinary research. Additionally, it reveals the problem-solving function of discourse. This sheds light on theoretical research into both corporate governance and business discourse. Practically, this book contributes to the improvement of Chinese banks’ awareness in CSR disclosure and the establishment of Chinese banks’ international images.

Scientists have warned that there is only a dozen of years left to cap temperatures from increasing by 1.5 degrees beyond which extreme weather patterns such as floods, droughts, and forest fires will intensify. In direct response to this, there has been a call for companies to be more transparent and align themselves to the guidelines to the Task Force for Climate Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This chapter seeks to explore the progress of publicly listed companies in Bursa Malaysia when it comes to adhering to the requirements of the TCFD. A TCFD Index (TI) is proposed to measure the degree of incorporation of the four main elements within TCFD: governance, strategy, risk management, as well as metrics and targets. Four performance groups are proposed to further characterize the TCFD alignment of companies based on classification analysis derived from the continuous data collected for TI. Findings show that the Malaysian companies tend to lag in terms of the adoption of TCFD. There is also variation in the carbon metrics disclosed by companies which make comparability difficult. This chapter highlights the challenges faced by Malaysian companies in implementing TCFD and proposes recommendations to address them. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Disclosures; Malaysia; Tcfd,,,"Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Globalization of Law and Local Wisdom Icglow 2019, (2019); Inaugural Meeting of Joint Committee on Climate Change, (2019); Global Investors Driving Business Transition, (2019); undefined, (2019); de Bernardi, Paola, The Relevance of Climate Change Related Risks on Corporate Financial and Non-Financial Disclosure in Italian Listed Companies, 1, pp. 77-107, (2019); Henningsson, Johan, Will the banker become a climate activist?, pp. 231-249, (2018); Fifth Assessment Report, (2019); Qualitative Content Analysis, (2000); Impacts and Adaptation, (2007); Sanderson, Hans, How do climate risks affect corporations and how could they address these risks?, SN Applied Sciences, 1, 12, (2019)",,Springer International Publishing,,,9783030424619; 9783030424626,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160810352,

Adaptive capacity includes the enhancement of general and specified resilience, which are attributes which may reduce efficiency or profitability. Adaptation finance faces a dual requirement to address both vulnerability and profitability. This complicates the design of financial instruments, giving rise to a need to compare the costs and benefits of resilience. The absence of a metric of adaptation performance beyond monetary investment implies that the gain in adaptive capacity cannot easily be compared with the loss in efficiency. This entry outlines a unified framework that integrates efficiency and vulnerability to determine the categories of financial instruments that can be utilized to direct capital toward the enhancement of adaptive capacity and resilience in specific situations. Instruments analyzed include insurance products, pay-for-success contracts, green and climate resilience bonds, asset-backed securities, biodiversity offset markets, and debt-for-nature swaps. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation Finance; Catastrophic Risk; Climate Resilience; General Resilience; Green Bonds; Index Insurance; Payments For Ecosystem Services; Stewardship,,,"Principles for Developing A Green Securitisation Market in Europe, (2019); International Lawyer, (1991); Delivering on the 100 Billion Climate Finance Commitment and Transforming Climate Finance, (2020); Schipper, E.

Nevertheless, difficulties of sustainability such as climate change and disruption have become more severe. Multi-stakeholders are crucially important to resolve difficulties posed to sustainability in global communities. Sustainable communities are expected to be constructed through competitive and cooperative schemes of multi-stakeholders. Sustainable global communities must reform centralized economies with top down systems and must move toward decentralized mechanisms known as bottom-up societies. Sustainable investment strategies to support environment, society and governance (ESG) presumably improve social welfare. The main findings presented herein are summarized as explained hereinafter. First, this article describes that multi-stakeholders can introduce a decentralized incentive scheme into global economies and can provide mathematical expressions of sustainable investment strategies. Secondly, the decentralized formulation described herein is used to evaluate the improvement of ESG initiatives by the decrease of social welfare losses. The formulation states mathematically relative relations among the investment strategies. Thirdly, this mathematical model explores the social welfare effects of initiatives to enhance standards, regulations, and legislations. Empirically, one finds that integration strategies have grown remarkably as a core part of social institutional reform for sustainability. Finally, initiatives to improve social evaluation by individuals who are excluded from market transaction are demonstrated to decrease social welfare losses greatly. These findings can promote initiatives to alleviate the disruption difficulties faced by communities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg; Integration; Multi-stakeholders; Risk Coefficient; Screening Of Investment; Sustainable Investment Strategies,,,"Economic Journal, (1990); Public Policy, (1973); Computers and Society Modern Perspectives, (2019); Post Growth Economics and Society Exploring the Paths of A Social and Ecological Transition, (2018); Social Inclusion and Usability of ICT Enabled Services, (2018); Coase, R.

In Anglo-American jurisdictions like Australia, corporate law and prudential regulatory frameworks contain obligations to identify, disclose and manage material financial risks that can be applied to climate-related risks. These legal frameworks have served as a foundation for the emergence of a range of private regulatory initiatives which seek to develop and apply best practice standards for climate risk disclosure and management, and which involve a range of different actors in driving the uptake of, and seeking to enforce, these standards. This paper explores the body of emerging private climate risk regulation, focusing particularly on the central organising theme of these initiatives: aligning private climate risk management to the climate mitigation goals of the international Paris Agreement. It outlines the way in which Paris-alignment and net-zero emissions are emerging as new norms guiding private sector approaches to climate change and explores how this interacts with and builds on essentially climateneutral, risk-based corporate law and prudential regulatory frameworks. While there is considerable potential in Australia for Paris-aligned private risk management to contribute meaningfully to achieving international climate mitigation goals, there are also well-founded concerns about the effectiveness of these private measures that require further investigation © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Risk Governance; Paris Agreement; Private Climate Regulation,,"127 This initiative is supported by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, CDP, Share Action and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility (ACCR).

Using a variety of data sources, we analyse public awareness (Google Trends) and financial possibilities (bank loans and bond issuances) for green initiatives. While public awareness and financing options have improved in India, our findings indicate that reducing asymmetric information through improved information management systems and increased collaboration among stakeholders could pave the way for more environmentally friendly and sustainable long-term economic growth.

Green banking has been developed and adopted as a banking ideology to reduce the adverse environmental impact of various polluting industries. The purpose of this study is to develop a multidimensional framework for green banking adoption which is in line with the United Nations-Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) 2030. Green banking can play an important part in the attainment of the UN-SDGs 2030. This study demonstrates the dimensions of green banking adoption that can be adopted by banks in order to facilitate the environmental sustainability of the country. The study proposes the framework for green banking adoption based on the natural resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm. The first-order constructs in the framework have been derived from the green capabilities proposed in NRBV of the firm. These reflective constructs lead towards the second-order construct of green banking adoption. The proposed framework is developed and justified on a theoretical basis and through secondary data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Green Audit; Green Banking Adoption; Green Building; Green Capabilities; Green Financing; Natural Resource-based View; Nrbv; Un-sdgs 2030; Climate Change; Environmental Impact; Green Audit; Green Banking Adoption; Green Buildings; Green Capability; Green Financing; Natural Resource-based View; Resource-based View; United Nation-sustainable Development Goal 2030; United Nations; Sustainable Development; Data; Degradation; Development; Dimensions; Impact; Lead,Climate change; Environmental impact; Green audit; Green banking adoption; Green buildings; Green capability; Green financing; Natural resource-based view; Resource-based view; United nation-sustainable development goal 2030; United Nations; Sustainable development; Data; Degradation; Development; Dimensions; Impact; Lead,,"Journal of Business and Economics, (2012); International Journal for Research in Management and Pharmacy, (2015); Aizawa, Motoko, Green credit, green stimulus, green revolution? china's mobilization of banks for environmental cleanup, Journal of Environment and Development, 19, 2, pp. 119-144, (2010); Am J Econ Business Mgt, (2019); Ali, Hikmat H., Developing a green building assessment tool for developing countries - Case of Jordan, Building and Environment, 44, 5, pp. 1053-1064, (2009); Ali, Qaisar, Islamic bankers' green behaviour for the growth of green banking in Malaysia, International Journal of Environment and Sustainable Development, 19, 4, pp. 393-411, (2020); Axis Bank Announces the Launch of Environmental Friendly Biodegradable Gift Cards, (2017); Azeem, Sana, Examining barriers and measures to promote the adoption of green building practices in Pakistan, Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 6, 3, pp. 86-100, (2017); Bae, Hee-sung, The Effect of Environmental Capabilities on Environmental Strategy and Environmental Performance of Korean Exporters for Green Supply Chain Management, Asian Journal of Shipping and Logistics, 33, 3, pp. 167-176, (2017); Policy Guidelines for Green Banking, (2013)",,Inderscience Publishers,,14746778,,IJESG,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144441994,

It has evolved to concern not just the financial health of the company, but its social and environmental impact. There is considerable international institutional diversity in corporate governance. The role and significance of market institutions varies among different governance systems. This work provides a concise insight into the defining impulses of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century corporate governance evolving through a series of competing epoch-making paradigmatic contests. The present paradigm highlights a shift towards corporate sustainability involving the corporate delivery of long-term value in financial, social, environmental, and ethical terms. In analysing the purpose of the company and the definition of value creation, the hegemony of agency theory and shareholder primacy is challenged. More expansive theoretical explanations are considered which recognise the deeper values companies are built upon, the wider purposes they serve, and the broader set of relationships they depend upon for their success.

While illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) remains an activity commonly perpetrated by criminal organizations, organized crime in fisheries extends across the spectrum of serious crimes. Organized crime in the fishing industry can take a variety of forms, ranging from trafficking in narcotics and arms to migrant smuggling and forced labor, among other nefarious activities. There is increasing interest in how the private sector can help to reduce IUU fishing and fisheries crimes by promoting transparency of supply chains in the fisheries industry and advancing synergies among stakeholders. This chapter analyzes the risks posed by organized crime to the fisheries industry and evaluates representative public-private partnerships against fisheries-related crimes and business-led initiatives.

It identifies the important themes in the green finance literature, particularly, the strategies to increase green financing; efforts to make green investment profitable; promoting green financing using technology and policy, the role of regulators and financial institutions in the green finance agenda, and the challenges of green financing. Several cross-country observations about the challenges of green finance and solutions to green finance issues are documented. The findings show that green finance has the potential to make a significant difference in the environment, society and for climate change mitigation, but many challenges abound such as the lack of awareness about green finance, inconsistent definitions of green finance, lack of policy coordination for green financing, inconsistent policies, and lack of profitable incentives to investors and financial institutions who are willing to invest in climate change mitigation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Climate Change Mitigation; Climate Finance; Cop26; Environment; Green Banks; Green Bonds; Green Finance; Green Investment; Green Loan; Literature Review; Paris Agreement; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Finance,,,"Asian Journal of Research in Business Economics and Management, (2012); Barber, Brad M., Impact investing, Journal of Financial Economics, 139, 1, pp. 162-185, (2021); Bebbington, Jan, Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: An enabling role for accounting research, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 31, 1, pp. 2-24, (2018); Bernstein, Steven, The United Nations and the governance of sustainable development goals, pp. 213-239, (2017); Green Finance Actors Challenges and Policy Recommendations, (2016); Corporate Social Responsibility Ethics and Sustainable Prosperity, (2019); Bergman, Noam M., Impacts of the fossil fuel divestment movement: Effects on finance, policy and public discourse, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 7, (2018); Rise of Green Finance in Europe, (2019); Blau, Judith R., The paris agreement: Climate change, solidarity, and human rights, pp. 1-119, (2017); Green Financeopportunities for the Austrian Financial Sector, (2020)",,Inderscience Publishers,,17449928; 17449936,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140837565,

Based on the definitions of the seminal concepts of vulnerability and risk and their constituent variables, we try to show how rational investment choices can support the targets of vulnerability and risk minimization on the basis of adaptation and disaster risk reduction policies. By using a recent classification of sustainable finance, then we suggest that the concepts and rationale of risk and vulnerability reduction targets are already consistent with financial approaches based on maximizing financial value and discuss how the shift from the latter to investment approaches where also social and environmental values are considered can integrate the adaptation and vulnerability and risk minimization objectives.

Climate shock arising from climate change incurs large-scale and integrated economic costs. Rising temperatures reduce not only output but also growth rates and political stability, thereby reducing industrial and agricultural production. Floods, storms, hurricanes, and earthquakes destroy habitats and assets such as roads and facilities, leading to economic production losses in future years. Determining the value of these production losses is an important component in assessing the welfare impact of climate change. This chapter presents the macroeconomic effects of global climate change. Firstly, a conceptual framework is presented for the costs of the effects of climate change. After this, an interaction process between the impact channels of climate change on the macroeconomy is evaluated in terms of economic growth, labor markets, labor productivity and sectors, which is explained using quantitative data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Economic Growth; Economic Sectors; Labor Markets; Labor Productivity; Macroeconomic Effect,,,"Abidoye, Babatunde O., Climate change and economic growth in Africa: An econometric analysis, Journal of African Economies, 24, 2, pp. 277-301, (2015); Adom, Philip Kofi, The role of climate adaptation readiness in economic growth and climate change relationship: An analysis of the output/income and productivity/institution channels, Journal of Environmental Management, 293, (2021); Paul Alagidede, Imhotep, The effect of climate change on economic growth: evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, 18, 3, pp. 417-436, (2016); Alene, Arega D., Productivity growth and the effects of R & D in African agriculture, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 41, 3-4, pp. 223-238, (2010); Arias, Charles, Corporate/higher Ed outlook: Going Green to Make Green, Hiring and looking for sustainable jobs, Sustainability, 2, 3, pp. 152-156, (2009); Baarsch, Florent, The impact of climate change on incomes and convergence in Africa, World Development, 126, (2020); Babiker, Mustafa H., Unemployment effects of climate policy, Environmental Science and Policy, 10, 7-8, pp. 600-609, (2007); Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, (2014); Climate Change and the Macro Economy A Critical Review, (2018); Battisti, David S., Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat, Science, 323, 5911, pp. 240-244, (2009)",,Elsevier Inc.,,,9780128240854; 9780128240847,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137851911,

The results of economic and mathematical modeling of the impact of the service quality management bank financing based on corporate social responsibility in the digital economy on sustainable development results, using the method of regression analysis, showed that standard corporate social responsibility in the digital economy does not have a positive effect on sustainable development. The novelty of the article lies in the development of a digital approach to the service quality managing of bank financing based on corporate social responsibility for sustainable development. All three areas of the service quality management of bank financing in a new approach - the manifestation of CSR, FinTech development and SDG support - are systemically interconnected and support each other. This ensures a constant improvement in the service quality of bank financing. Improving the security of banking (it is recommended to increase it by 97.28%) and development of Internet banking (it is recommended to increase it by 96.81%) are proposed as measures for the practical implementation of the new approach. Due to the practical implementation of the proposed author’s recommendations, the level of sustainable development will become the maximum (reach 1st place), that is, increase by 96.64%.

Historically, identifying the low performance of equipment occurs with inspections on the mining faces or through management reports. However, through the advent of technology and greater processing and data transmission capacity, many companies have developed research to improve the decision-making process to identify events in real-time to increase mine safety and act on low-performance equipment. Thus, this paper presents the development of a cyber-physical system to control loading productivity for open-pit mines. Furthermore, the tool allows analysis of the productivity, which generates alarms in low-performance situations measured according to pre-established targets. In the practical applications of the method, the increase in loading productivity reached 4.71% by reducing process variability. In addition, the stability of the loading operation resulted in the lowest queues, fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cyber-physical System; Data Analysis; Decision-making Process; Environmental Impacts; Fleet Management System; Load Equipment Performance; Mining Industry; Productivity; Cyber Physical System; Data Handling; Decision Making; Embedded Systems; Fleet Operations; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Information Management; Loading; Open Pit Mining; Productivity; Sustainable Development; Cybe-physical Systems; Cyber-physical Systems; Decision-making Process; Equipment Performance; Fleet Management System; Load Equipment; Load Equipment Performance; Mining Face; Production Process; Environmental Impact,Cyber Physical System; Data handling; Decision making; Embedded systems; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Loading; Open pit mining; Productivity; Sustainable development; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Decision-making process; Equipment performance; Fleet management system; Load equipment; Load equipment performance; Mining face; Production process; Environmental impact,This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior–Brasil (CAPES)–Finance Code 001.,"Alarie, Stéphane, Overview of solution strategies used in truck dispatching systems for open pit mines, International Journal of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Environment, 16, 1, pp. 59-76, (2002); Barbosa, Rodrigo Correia, Non-deterministic load and dump behaviour in mining haul trucks: a case of study, Mining Technology: Transactions of the Institutions of Mining and Metallurgy, 130, 3, pp. 188-194, (2021); Barr, Russell, Modeling for real-time performance measurement: A strategic approach, Mining Engineering, 59, 3, pp. 32-38, (2007); Boulter, Ashley, Wireless network requirements for the successful implementation of automation and other innovative technologies in open-pit mining, International Journal of Mining, Reclamation and Environment, 29, 5, pp. 368-379, (2015); Tecnol Em Metal Mater Min, (2018); Chaowasakoo, Patarawan, Digitalization of mine operations: Scenarios to benefit in real-time truck dispatching, International Journal of Mining Science and Technology, 27, 2, pp. 229-236, (2017); Chen, Xianzhan, Coal seam drainage enhancement using borehole presplitting basting technology – A case study in Huainan, International Journal of Mining Science and Technology, 27, 5, pp. 771-775, (2017); Coronado, Pedro Pablo Vasquez, Optimization of open Pit haulage cycle using a KPI controlling alert system and a discrete-event operations simulator, pp. 34-44, (2015); Edwards, David John, Artificial intelligence approach to calculation of hydraulic excavator cycle time and output, Transactions of the Institutions of Mining and Metallurgy, Section A: Mining Technology, 109, JAN/APRIL, pp. A23-A29, (2000); Emmanouilidis, Christos, Enabling the human in the loop: Linked data and knowledge in industrial cyber-physical systems, Annual Reviews in Control, 47, pp. 249-265, (2019)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,25726676; 25726668,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132140203,

This recent development is propelled by concerns that financial markets have underestimated, and are unprepared for, the costs and losses that will follow as the effects of climate change escalate. It is also driven by the enormous scale of investments required to facilitate the transition to a low-emission society. The Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are one example of a response to these developments in the realm of financial policymaking. They aim to encourage disclosure of climate-related risks, by introducing new categories of risk – namely, physical risk and transition risk.

It approaches it within the context of the need for more effective, efficient and just systems of redress for the victims of human rights and environmental harm that is caused by companies where they have operations or supply chains in single or multiple jurisdictions. Developments within the field of corporate responsibility for human rights and environmental issues have led to a variety of different initiatives that range from the UN 'protect, respect, and remedy' framework and the associated human rights due diligence (HRDD) framework, to specific legal developments in certain jurisdictions and other schemes developed by international organisations, as well as by civil-society and businesses themselves. From the perspective of corporate law, these changes have taken place within a legal framework that has certain features that have hindered the availability of remedies for victims of associated human rights and environmental harm. This article problematises the issue of redress for corporate human rights violations and environmental degradation within the context of international developments in this field. It considers whether there is a prima facie case for the establishment of a comprehensive compulsory human rights and environmental insurance regime for companies that would require them to operate to a high standard of care in their operations, and which would ultimately provide a more straightforward system of redress for victims. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Compulsory Liability Insurance; Corporate Accountability; Due Diligence; Environment; Human Rights Due Diligence,,,"Multinational Corporations in World Development, (2025); undefined; Just Business Multinational Corporations and Human Rights, (2013); Protect Respect and Remedy A Framework for Business and Human Rights, (2008); Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Implementing the United Nations Protect Respect and Remedy Framework, (2011); Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises, (2011); OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, (2000); Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy Adopted by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office at Its 204th Session, (1977); Statement on the Purpose of A Corporation, (2019); Turner, Stephen J., Corporate Law, Directors’ Duties and ESG Interventions: Analysing Pathways towards Positive Corporate Impacts Relating to ESG issues, Journal of Business Law, 2020, 4, pp. 245-264, (2020)",,Brill Nijhoff,,18719732; 18719740,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127852506,

It has changed the way in which communities, governments and businesses interact with each other, how they contract one with another and what legal disputes they face. National and international legal frameworks currently in place rarely provide the necessary mechanisms to resolve new kinds of disputes that have emerged and as a result, important gaps remain. International commercial arbitration is uniquely placed to respond to the transboundary nature of climate change. Its inherent flexibility, innovativeness, ability to deal with complex, cross-border issues and the possibility to choose a neutral adjudicator according to his/her expertise give commercial arbitration an important advantage over court litigation. However, some of its characteristics that are seen as welcome and desired in different contexts create important challenges for achieving climate justice. Therefore, innovation in this area will be necessary if commercial arbitration is to become an attractive option for resolving climate change-related disputes between businesses. The arbitration community should try to find constructive ways in which commercial arbitration can innovate itself so that it can complement other methods of dispute resolution traditionally used for climate change disputes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Arbitration Clause; Campaign For Greener Arbitrations; Chancery Lane Project; Climate Change; Climate Justice; Cop 26; Esg; Expertise; International Commercial Arbitration; Paris Agreement; Private Finance; Transparency,,,"Playing It Forward Path Dependency Progressive Incrementalism and the Super Wicked Problem of Global Climate Change, (2010); Flint Water Crisis Everything You Need to Know, (2018); Secretary General S Remarks on Climate Change as Delivered, (2018); Achieving Justice and Human Rights in an Era of Climate Disruption, (2014); 5 Lse Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment Laws and Policies; Ibid; 7 Icc Commission Report Resolving Climate Change Related Disputes Through Arbitration and Adr 8, (2019); 10 United Nations Climate Change Paris Agreement Status of Ratification; 11 Special Report Global Warming of 1 5ºc 15, (2019); Stern, Nicholas H., The economics of climate change: The stern review, 9780521877251, pp. 1-692, (2007)",,Kluwer Law International,,02558106; 2212182X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125233867,

This article aims to contribute to efforts to identify effective international policy levers to address plastic pollution. It takes stock of the evolution of views and perceptions on this complex and multi-faceted topic—from concerns about marine pollution and waste management towards new strategic directions that involve the entire plastics life-cycle and include climate and health impacts associated with the proliferation of plastics. It also traces the progressive development of responses—from voluntary approaches invovling multiple stakeholders to national and international approaches focused on regulation. The paper is informed by desk research, a literature review and participation by the authors in informal and formal global governance processes on plastic pollution, the environment and development in the United Nations and World Trade Organization between 2019 and 2021. It also draws on empirical findings from a novel and original database on the life-cycle of plastic trade created by the authors. The paper argues that the important focus on downstream dimensions of plastic pollution—and strategies to address them—needs to be complemented by a broad life-cycle and “upstream” perspective that addresses plastic pollution at its source. It highlights the political economy tensions and inconsistencies at hand, observing that while some countries are taking concerted efforts to reduce pollution (including through bans on certain kinds of plastic and plastic products); to promote more circular plastic economies; and to reduce the carbon footprint of plastics (as part of a wider effort to decarbonize their economies), trade and investment in the plastic industry continues to rise. The paper argues that to reduce plastic pollution, emerging global governance efforts must integrate international environmental law and cooperation with a complementary and enabling global framework that addresses the economic, financial, industrial and trade policies needed to drive the necessary transformation of the plastics sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Circular Economy; Development; Environ-ment; Global Governance; Plastic Policies; Plastic Pollution; Plastic Waste; Trade,,Funding: The authors note with gratitude financial support from the Swiss Network of International Studies SNIS and in-kind support from UNCTAD.,"Alaerts, Luc, Impact of bio-based plastics on current recycling of plastics, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 5, (2018); Progress Report, (2020); Rise of the Rest Challenges to the West from Late Industrializing Economies, (2001); Chemical Industry Investment Linked to Shale Gas Reaches 200 Billion, (2018); Malaysia Flooded with Plastic Waste to Send Back Some Scrap to Source, (2019); Plastic Climate the Hidden Costs of A Plastic Planet, (2019); undefined, (2021); Transforming the Global Plastics Economy the Political Economy and Governance of Plastics Production and Pollution, (2020); Banks Bonds and the Petrochemicals Plastics Industry Greening the Path from Copenhagen Agreement Covid and Beyond, (2021); Industrial Policy and Sustainable Growth, (2018)",,MDPI,,20760760,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123260457,

The present study proposes conceptual model of Green banking initiatives and studies the impact of three Green banking initiatives, viz. green products development, green corporate social responsibility and green internal process on two possible outcomes, viz. Green brand image and Green trust. The study is qualitative in nature comprising of semistructured in-depth interviews conducted with 36 middle- to senior-level managers of twelve public and private Indian banks. Banking sector can play a crucial role in greening the banking system by enhancing the availability of finance and serve the needs of a “green economy”. The findings of the study revealed that 63% of the total respondents were of view that their bank indulges in development of several green banking products and services, 53% of the bankers said that their bank incorporates green internal processes in their daily activities, and 78% respondents said that their bank undertakes several green corporate social responsibility initiatives. This investigation further highlights that more than 60% respondents believed that Green banking initiatives have positive role in restoring customer trust through enhanced Green brand image.

In this Viewpoint, we argue that it should not be the role of the public sector to cover the full costs of adaptation - which would also typically exceed government's fiscal space. Rather, we suggest that the public sector should set the right conditions to catalyse private investments in adaptation. While the suggestion is not new, we argue that the current focus on generic ‘barriers’ hindering more private investments in adaptation is not expedient. These barriers are descriptive rather than explanatory, sometimes mix cause and effect, and tend to focus on eliminating obstacles, rather than adapting efficiently. Alternatively, we suggest to focus on addressing three market imperfections that give rise to those barriers. In doing so, the overall welfare of society, including the vulnerability of the most marginalized, should be centre-stage. The development of markets should aim to contribute to such welfare - it is not an end in itself. In that sense, our call for a focus on market imperfections is a call for a larger role of public actors, both in developed and developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation Barriers; Adaptation Finance; Market Imperfections; Private Sector; Public Interventions,,"Funding text 1: Recognizing the externalities of different adaptation strategies and measures helps to identify opportunities for policy and financing mechanisms in order to remove or decrease market imperfections (see Bisaro & Hinkel, ; Woodruff et al., ). For example, a project or company could charge fees for the positive externality in order to improve the return on investment. In 2001, the Government of Malaysia developed the concept of a mixed-use tunnel that allows for traffic flow under normal circumstances, and that provides for storm water diversion during heavy rains. Private investments were secured by allowing a portion of the tunnel to be tolled for traffic, as these covered the operation costs and repaid the companies’ investments (Gardiner et al., ). An alternative way to compensate for positive externalities is to use public finance instruments such as grants or subsidized loans to bring down the cost of capital and increase the expected return on investment. For example, the Kayonza Growers Tea Factory in Uganda implemented wetland protection measures to prevent soil erosion, floods and increase water storage that also benefits the wider community. The factory might not have made this investment itself as there was no return on investment. Instead, the project received public grant finance through the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and the charity Comic Relief. The size of the investment subsidy should reflect the value of the public good (or positive externality) provided by the project.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Bundesministerium f?r wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung: [Grant Number GZ: 414 K8187-0372/001].

Following an extensive critical comparative review of literature resulting in the identification of ten potential obstacles, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 520 construction industry professionals. Data obtained from the survey were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings from the study revealed that split incentives, risk related barriers, capital expenditure, lack of incentives, and initial capital cost are the key obstacles that hinder green building project financing. The findings further revealed significant differences in the views of the professionals regarding four obstacles to green building project financing. From the discussion, it was realized that for some of the identified obstacles, the differences resulted from the fact that the different professionals have different interests in green building projects, and those interests depict the kind of risks they are exposed to. The value of this paper is to help built environment professionals to understand these obstacles and find a better way of turning these challenges into opportunities for the construction industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Construction Industry; Construction Professionals; Ghana; Green Building Projects; Obstacles; Project Financing,,,"undefined, (2016); Agyekum, Kofi, Factors driving the adoption of green certification of buildings in Ghana, Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 9, 4, pp. 595-613, (2020); Agyekum, Kofi, Barriers to the adoption of green certification of buildings: A thematic analysis of verbatim comments from built environment professionals, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 17, 5, pp. 1035-1055, (2019); Ampratwum, Godslove, A framework for the implementation of green certification of buildings in Ghana, International Journal of Construction Management, 21, 12, pp. 1263-1277, (2021); Proceedings of the 4 Th International Conference on Sustainability Engineering and Science, (2010); Berry, Stephen Robert, The impact of niche green developments in transforming the building sector: The case study of lochiel park, Energy Policy, 62, pp. 646-655, (2013); Bird, Stephen D., Policy options for the split incentive: Increasing energy efficiency for low-income renters, Energy Policy, 48, pp. 506-514, (2012); Bonett, Douglas G., Cronbach's alpha reliability: Interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and sample size planning, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 36, 1, pp. 3-15, (2015); undefined, (2010); undefined, (2014)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,15623599; 23312327,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093497306,

In lieu of Ghana announcing the possibility of its first green bonds, it is crucial that lessons are taken from the past developments to reinforce the prospects of a salutary rollout. This paper explores factors recommended as success dependent in the Ghanaian markets. A quantitative approach is employed. Twelve factors are extracted from a review of the available literature and converted into a questionnaire targeted at professionals in financial institutions. This included managers and financial analysts, as well as top management personnel. In total, 54 questionnaires were distributed. A total of 32 responses were received, proportional to a response rate of 60.37% and was analyzed with relative importance index and one-sample t-test. The results indicate that ‘Good Credit Ratings, Provision of Local Guidelines, Proper Green Qualifications Criteria, and Prioritizing Viable Projects’ are highest ranked factors. It is important that these are incorporated in the framework to be designed for the rollout of green bonds in the Ghana. Considerations should also be made with respect to the culture and state of the financial markets in the country while bringing out the appropriate structure to facilitate the issuances. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Challenges; Ghana; Green Bonds; Infrastructure Projects; Success Factors,,We thank Mr. Caleb Debrah and Mr. Prince Antwi-Afari for their insightful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

Like other crises the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred public and private entities to become engaged in significant redevelopment efforts. Policymakers in some countries view these efforts as an opening for not only including other issues such as deficits in infrastructure and the social systems, but also for redefining their political priorities towards a “green economy”. While pursuing various policy objectives at the same time is a prudent undertaking, it seems rather questionable that politicians, under the pressure of ecological activism, would evaluate all crisis policy measures by their effect on environmental outcomes. We are seeing this in the European Union (EU) as it is about to couple its Recovery and Resilience Facility (financed through the “Next Generation EU Recovery Fund”) with its Green Deal. In the U.S., so far, the Build Back Better package and the American Rescue Plan seem to seek separate evaluation schemes for their different policy fields. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the wide-ranging opinions that exist on the intention to make recovery support contingent on ecological effects: For example, there is the classic Tinbergen Rule which states that for each policy target there must be at least one policy tool; thus, if there are fewer tools than targets, then some policy goals will not ultimately be achieved. Likewise, long-term climate change mitigation can only be achieved with long-term policies that consider and weigh out all externalities. Moreover, embarking on long term recovery plans cannot solely be formulated and implemented on ex-ante definitions of ecological impacts. The paper raises the question whether requesting ecological effects from all recovery programs is just and fair. It contrasts the various options of coupling recovery efforts and climate mitigation with state-of-the-art approaches of valuating multiple externalities: weighing the diverse externalities of policy projects can determine which policy tools to choose. It also demonstrates the downside of a policy that are solely focuses on granting financial support, if not, a project can effectively meet a pre-specified ecological and energy goal as set up by the EU and which ranks recovery projects according to their arbitrary effect on climate change. A wider scope of decision criteria will produce more effective ways to “build back better”. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Externalities; Post Covid-19; Recovery Programs; Tinbergen Rule,,,"Battiston, Stefano, A climate stress-test of the financial system, Nature Climate Change, 7, 4, pp. 283-288, (2017); Braathen, Nils Axel, Instrument mixes for environmental policy: How many stones should be used to kill a bird?, International Review of Environmental and Resource Economics, 1, 2, pp. 185-235, (2007); Sustainable Finance in Europe Corporate Governance Financial Stability and Financial Markets, (2021); de la Peña, Rogelio, Should monetary policy lean against the wind in a small-open economy?

The study was conducted in 2020 using an anonymous online survey following an analytical method based on principles, criteria and indicators. Respondents rated the quality of these initiatives on a Likert scale (1-5) based on 11 indicators. The results show that the Sustainable Ocean Initiative received the highest score, while Marine permaculture scored the lowest. blue economy initiatives were considered inclusive by respondents; however, resources and capacity were deemed insufficient. Respondents from the Global South (developing countries) rated the initiatives higher than those from the Global North (developed countries) perhaps because developing countries are the prime beneficiaries of these programmes and receive more funding and assistance. These findings support policy and decision-makers formulating policies based on stakeholders' opinions and focussing on low-scoring initiatives. The blue economy is a growing sector with high potential for sustainable development; however, various factors, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, are obstructing its advancement. Therefore, effective communication, collaborative efforts and substantial and sustainable finance are vital for ensuring the sustainability of the blue economy in both the Global North and the Global South. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blue economy; COVID-19; Global north; Global south; Governance; Stakeholders; Sustainability,,,"2040 Marine Permaculture, (2021); Feeding Africa, (2015); Alemañ, Alejandro Espi, Development of seaweed cultivation in Latin America: current trends and future prospects, Phycologia, 58, 5, pp. 462-471, (2019); Alexander, Karen A., The human side of marine ecosystem-based management (EBM): ‘Sectoral interplay’ as a challenge to implementing EBM, Marine Policy, 101, pp. 33-38, (2019); Araújo, Rita M., Current Status of the Algae Production Industry in Europe: An Emerging Sector of the Blue Bioeconomy, Frontiers in Marine Science, 7, (2021); Balgos, Miriam C., A comparative analysis of ocean policies in fifteen nations and four regions, pp. 3-48, (2015); Barbesgaard, Mads, Blue growth: savior or ocean grabbing?, Journal of Peasant Studies, 45, 1, pp. 130-149, (2018); Bennett, Nathan J., Navigating a just and inclusive path towards sustainable oceans, Marine Policy, 97, pp. 139-146, (2018); Bennett, Nathan J., Ocean grabbing, Marine Policy, 57, pp. 61-68, (2015); Bond, Patrick, Blue Economy threats, contradictions and resistances seen from South Africa, Journal of Political Ecology, 26, 1, pp. 341-362, (2019)",,De Gruyter,,,9783110733488; 9783110738292,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140810832,

Neither problem will be solved if we ignore the ocean. To turn the tide in favour of humanity and a habitable planet, we need to recognize and better value the fundamental role that the ocean plays in the earth system, and prioritize the urgent action needed to heal and protect the ocean at the ‘Earthscape’ level – the planetary scale at which processes to support life operate. The countries gathering at COP26 have unparalleled political capacity and leadership to make this happen. COP26 could be the turning point, but there must be commitment to united action for the ocean, as well as planning to meet those commitments, based on science-led solutions that address the interconnectivity of the ocean, climate, and biodiversity. Key ways in which the ocean both contributes to and acts as the major buffer for climate change are summarized, focusing on temperature, but not forgetting the role of storing carbon. It is noted with ‘high confidence’ that the ocean has stored 91% of the excess heat from global warming, with land, melting ice, and the atmosphere only taking up approximately 5, 3, and 1%, respectively. We also highlight the impact of the recent large release of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere during the 2015–2016 El Niño. We then present six science-based policy actions that form a recovery stimulus package for people, climate, nature, and the planet.

Europe Union member states, including the V4 countries, are particularly exposed to economic cyber-espionage, because of the advanced know-how of the companies based therein. Under international law, there exists no uniform approach to the matter; also at the European Union level, the legal framework appears rather fragmented and the same holds true at the national level and within the V4 group, where each country has adopted its own relevant regulation. After a general overview of the relevant international and EU regulatory framework of reference, this article overviews the modus operandi of the V4 and examines its approach to economic cyber-espionage, with a special focus on Hungary as case study. As already remarked at the European and international levels, cybersecurity policies and regulations, including those regarding economic cyber-espionage operations, should be drafted in coordination among states; the V4 group can become a privileged platform of discussion to advance in the regulatory harmonisation of the issues at stake. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cyber-security; Economic Cyber-espionage; Governance; Hungary; Visegrád Group,,,"U K Agrees with China Not to Support Cyber Theft of Intellectual Property Defense Daily 29 October, (2015); Role of Regional and Sub Regional Organizations in Implementing Un Security Council Resolution 1540 A Preliminary Assessment of the African Continent, (2008); Buchan, Russell, Cyber Espionage and International Law, pp. 1-220, (2018); Cabada, Ladislav, The Visegrad cooperation in the context of other central European cooperation formats, Politics in Central Europe, 14, 2, pp. 165-179, (2018); Australia China Agree to Oppose Cyber Ip Theft IT News 24 April, (2017); International Law on the Eve of the 21st Century Views from the International Law Commission, (1997); Bloomberg Blog, (2021); Euipo, (2018); Cybersecurity in the Time of Covid 19 Council on Foreign Relations Blog 30 March, (2020); 2020 in Review the Covid 19 Pandemic and Cyberspace Council on Foreign Relations Blog 14 December, (2020)",,Sciendo,,18013422,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123795892,

Forestry is one of the industries with the greatest dependencies on natural capital, as well as having the potential for substantial positive or negative impacts on natural capital. These dependencies and impacts create direct risks to a forestry enterprise’s ongoing financial viability, which translate into indirect risks for investors and society. There are growing demands from a variety of stakeholders for more reliable information to assess such risks, but at present, these risks are not always well understood, assessed or communicated in a consistent and comparable way. This paper addresses this problem by applying a standardized methodology to develop the first systematic, evidence-based review and financial materiality assessment of natural capital risks for the Australian forestry sector. Recent Findings: The vast potential scope of forestry impacts and dependencies on natural capital can be reduced to twenty key areas of relevance to Australian forestry, of which only seven to nine have been assessed as highly financially material for each of the sub-sectors of softwood plantations, hardwood plantations and native forestry. The majority of risks assessed as highly financially material are related to dependencies on natural capital. This is in part due to the fact that current regulations and certification schemes focus on managing impacts, but tend to overlook dependencies. Nearly all of the natural capital risks rated as highly material are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Summary: An improved understanding of natural capital risks is an important input to better decision-making by forestry enterprises, as well as their lenders and investors, forestry regulators and other relevant stakeholders. This paper contributes to the preparedness of the forestry industry and its stakeholders to address questions about vulnerability to future changes and declining trends in natural capital. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dependency; Forestry; Impact; Materiality; Natural Capital; Risk Assessment,,"All authors received funding from the National Institute for Forestry Product Innovation (NIFPI) (Launceston) under the grant NT011, NIFPI is supported by the Australian and Tasmanian State Governments.

The review was followed by office and field visits for verification. The office visit helped crosscheck the findings, and the field observations carried out between December 2020 and April 2021 asked 24 key informants and collected supplementary information appraisal and indicator development. Of the CCA projects studied, the most (n = 48, 32%) were community-based initiatives, while the least (n = 12, 8%) were ecosystem-based interventions. The main environment-centered projects were Ecosystem-based Adaptations and Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities (EPIC) while Enhanced Action of Inclusive CSOs for Participation in Climate Resilient Economic Growth (UTHAN), Initiative for CCA (ICCA), Support to Rural Livelihoods and Climate Change Adaptation in the Himalayas (HIMALICA), etc., adaptation projects were community-based. Capacity building and awareness-raising were the major thrust of the CbA projects, while the abatement of climate vulnerabilities and risks through nature-based solutions were priorities of EbA. Payment for Ecosystem services is a nature-based solution that can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change at a local scale by adopting community-based and culturally appropriate methods and enhancing and incentivizing adaptation measures and capacities. A set of 11 criteria and 40 indicators comprised the institutional and behavioral responses and the use of technologies, and the design of climate-resilient plans and climate-smart practices were proposed as appraisal measures to evaluate the success of CCA interventions. The importance of criteria and indicators lies in the fact that such a comprehensive assessment would lead to effective and efficient adaptation projects, which could help benefit beyond the borders. It also furthers ongoing adaptation interventions and is set to be an integral part of associated studies and monitoring and review of new adaptation interventions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Disaster Risk; Himalaya; Indicators; Project; Resilience; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Ecosystem Service; Institutional Framework; Rapid Rural Appraisal; Risk Assessment; Rural Area; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; United Nations Framework Convention On Climate Change; Vulnerability; Himalayas; Indicator Indicator,adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; institutional framework; rapid rural appraisal; risk assessment; rural area; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; vulnerability; Himalayas; Indicator indicator,"Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the Forestry and Agriculture University (AFU), Nepal, for supporting the research work.

This study investigates the impact of Accra's growth and expansion on its natural green spaces, availability, and ecosystem services delivery. The study uses remotely sensed imageries (Landsat 1991–2018) for land use change analysis, the i-Tree Canopy model to quantify and value of urban ecosystems and stakeholder interviews to explore perceptions on green space value. Results showed that the overwhelming number of stakeholders understand and are aware of the beneficial values of urban green spaces but highlight poor planning, coupled with land tenure challenges, as a threat to the conservation of green spaces. Land use and land cover change analysis shows that the urban built environment has expanded from 55.1% to 83.79% at the expense of the natural environment, including green spaces, which have declined from 41% to 15% over 27 years. Existing areas of green spaces, including the Achimota forest, the University of Ghana campus and street trees on major roads, were valued at US$37,610,980 for carbon sequestration and storage, US$1,478,173 for air pollution regulation and US$458 for avoided runoff. A rapid assessment of the availability, accessibility and management of urban green spaces in the Accra metropolis can be an essential step towards identifying and mapping their consumptive and non-consumptive use-value and introducing appropriate interventions necessary for enhancing the city's resilience in an era of climate change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accra; Ecosystem Services; Green Spaces; Remote Sensing; Urban,,,"undefined, (2019); Future of the Tree Towards Growth and Development of Kumasi, (2011); A Masters Thesis Submitted to the School of Graduate Studies, (2014); International Journal of Ecosystem, (2014); Developing Country Studies, (2016); Akubia, John E.K., Unravelling the frontiers of urban growth: Spatio-Temporal dynamics of land-use change and urban expansion in greater Accra metropolitan area, Ghana, Land, 8, 9, (2019); J Environ Ecol, (2016); Anarfi, Kwasi, Highlighting the sustainability implications of urbanisation: A comparative analysis of two urban areas in Ghana, Land, 9, 9, (2020); Management of Urban Land in Ghana the Case of Accra and Kumasi Metropolitan Areas, (2012); Avelar, Silvania, Linking socioeconomic classes and land cover data in Lima, Peru: Assessment through the application of remote sensing and GIS, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 11, 1, pp. 27-37, (2009)",,Elsevier B.V.,,26670100,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118510351,

This is particularly true for banks lending to agriculture: a sector with both significant impacts and critical dependencies on natural capital. Bank lending is a vital source of new finance for the sector, which is essential to achieve sustainable intensification targets. Yet current credit decision-making practice is still based on conventional financial and management indicators, lacking any systematic assessment of natural capital risks, especially those associated with dependencies. Operationalising natural capital risk assessment requires practicable indicators and data to evaluate the most material natural capital risks for a given sub-sector and geography, but it is unclear to what extent these are available. We assess the practicability of natural capital dependency risk indicators and data sources for a critical case study of Australian sheep production. We find that at least moderately practicable indicators and data sources are available to assess the 11 major dependency risks that are material for this industry. Challenges remain in determining risk thresholds for most indicators, and quantifying risk impacts on profitability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Credit Risk Assessment; Environmental Data; Indicators; Materiality; Natural Capital; Sheep Production,,This work was supported by the Cooperative Research Centre for the Australian Sheep Industry (Sheep CRC) .,"Alexander, George, Heat stress and development of the conceptus in domestic sheep, Journal of Agricultural Science, 76, 1, pp. 53-72, (1971); World Agriculture Towards 2030 2050 the 2012 Revision, (2012); Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for Cattle, (2014); undefined, (2000); Australia State of the Environment 2016, (2017); Case Studies of Environmental Risk Analysis Methodologies, (2020); Natural Capital Credit Risk Assessment in Agricultural Lending an Approach Based on the Natural Capital Protocol, (2019); Ascui, Francisco, Implementing natural capital credit risk assessment in agricultural lending, Business Strategy and the Environment, 28, 6, pp. 1234-1249, (2019); CSIRO, (2011); Bolger, Terry P., Water use efficiency and water use of Mediterranean annual pastures in southern Australia, Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 50, 6, pp. 1035-1046, (1999)",,Elsevier B.V.,,22120416,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116878436,

It has been argued that if well implemented, upstream activities have a trickledown effect on the local content policy linkages that apart from taxes, can lead to improved financial and social benefits. In this study, how Ghana can use local content policy in upstream oil and gas operations to maximum economic and social benefits for the good of the Ghana government, citizens, and the Multinational Oil Companies, is the main question to be answered? To address this question, comprehensive analysis of local content laws and policies and stakeholder consultations are conducted. The paper argues that an effective local content policy towards achieving sustainability in the upstream oil and gas industry demands balancing the needs of policymakers, local communities, Multinational Oil Companies, and regulators to succeed. The study recommends a local content implementation master plan; active participation of key stakeholders (government, citizens and Multinational Oil Companies); and integration of forward and backward linkages in the implementation of Ghana’s upstream local content laws and policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Contemporary Issues; Local Content Implementation; Multinational Oil And Gas Companies; Policy Management; Sustainable Development; Upstream Oil And Gas Industry; Gas Industry; Governance Approach; Local Economy; Oil Industry; Participatory Approach; Policy Implementation; Social Impact; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development; Ghana,gas industry; governance approach; local economy; oil industry; participatory approach; policy implementation; social impact; stakeholder; sustainable development; Ghana,"We found that financial constraints serve as a roadblock to Indigenous Ghanaian Companies (IGC) participation in the upstream oil and gas sector. Ref. [] identified two aspects of the problem viz ineffective capital mobilization and higher interest rates. The long-term financing needs of the oil and gas industry remains a challenge due to the lack of specialized investment banks. Syndicated loans could solve the problem, but local banks lack adequate capital and cannot support the high-risk exposure in the upstream oil and gas sector. To solve the local content funding problem, the Oil and Gas Business Development and Local Content Fund (OGBDLCF), supported by the MOCs, was established to support education, training, and research and development for the government to address the human resource gap. The Petroleum Commission is currently developing guidelines to operationalize the local content fund (LCF). This fund is supposed to provide financial assistance to the IGCs to help them compete in the sector. The LCF is supposed to be funded by 1% of every contract signed in the sector. However, there is very little cooperation from MOCs in contributing to the LCF. While the idea might be welcoming for local companies, it’s not in the long-term interest of the MOCs. Stricter enforcement and supervision or a consultative approach is required to compel/convince the MOCs to honour this contractual requirement of funding the LCF.","Unpacking Local Content Requirements in the Extractive Sector What Implications for the Global Trade and Investment Frameworks, (2015); Ovadia, Jesse Salah, Local content policies and petro-development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A comparative analysis, Resources Policy, 49, pp. 20-30, (2016); Ngoasong, Michael Zisuh, How international oil and gas companies respond to local content policies in petroleum-producing developing countries: A narrative enquiry, Energy Policy, 73, pp. 471-479, (2014); National Oil Companies and Value Creation, (2011); Acheampong, Theophilus, An assessment of local-content policies in oil and gas producing countries, Journal of World Energy Law and Business, 9, 4, pp. 282-302, (2016); Guidance Document Reporting on the Principles for Responsible Banking, (2020); Obeng-Odoom, Franklin, Global political economy and Frontier economies in Africa: Implications from the oil and gas industry in Ghana, Energy Research and Social Science, 10, pp. 41-56, (2015); Extr Industr Soc, (2019); Management Science Letters, (2012); Journal of Strategic Contracting and Negotiation, (2017)",,Springer Nature,,26629984,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111932625,

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the size of an economy and the governance structure of a country is relevant for ESG accounting practice. Design/methodology/approach: The study applied content analysis on 602 annual reports of 67 banks in 5 countries in West Africa. A generalised method of moments (GMM) estimation technique was used for the regression analysis. Findings: The evidence showed that GDP has a positive and insignificant relationship with ESG reporting, suggesting that the size of an economy is not relevant for ESG accounting. The study further found that Corruption Perception Index has a positive and significant relationship with ESG accounting. This result implies that a country’s political environment is germane for ESG accounting. Firm-specific factors, such as firms’ size, value and age have positive and significant relationships with ESG accounting while net profit margin and leverage have negative relationships with ESG accounting. The study concludes that a country’s institutional environment influences the ESG accounting practices of its firms. Practical implications: The governments of countries in West Africa must lay an enabling political and economic foundation to improve the accounting practices of firms, which is a critical factor for attracting investments.

However, to date, the renewable energy (RE) sector has attracted only marginal investor interest. This paper aims to identify the challenges faced in financing RE in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of literature in renewable energy finance was conducted and 12 financing challenges were identified. From this list, a questionnaire was developed asking to rank barriers. This was distributed to experts within financial institutions and 32 were returned. A factor analysis and severity index analysis were performed to identify a ranking of challenges impeding RE project financing in Ghana. Findings: The challenges to RE financing fall into the three broad categories, namely, “economic, commercial and regulatory” challenges. Within these broad constraints, “long payback periods,” “limited track record” and “high upfront cost” are the most severe impediments to obtaining financing for RE. Practical implications: Identifying the specific conditions that make an investment in RE unattractive, give policymakers set on achieving the 10% RE goal, a way forward in developing a targeted policy that would mitigate identified investor disincentives. Originality/value: The broad range of potential barriers to investment are known. However, this study combines a specific governmental ambition – encouraging the financing of RE – with a specific set of identified barriers inhibiting that ambition. In this regard, this study identifies exactly where the government needs to act if it is to facilitate investment in RE, as is required for Ghana to reach its 10% RE target. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Economic Development; Ghana; Project Finance; Renewable Energy; Sub-saharan Africa; Sustainability,,"Funding text 1: The 400 MW Bui Hydroelectric Power Station was commissioned in December 2013 ).

It recognises that the approaches from different communities of lawyers to the negative impacts on human rights and the environment caused by companies, sometimes operate in isolation from each other, are not always mutually supportive, can lead to a fragmentation of effort, and may not address the root causes of the problem. In particular, this article analyses the extent to which existing approaches tend to address symptoms of the issues, rather than the root causes themselves. It makes the case that in this regard specific root causes exist within the frameworks of corporate law in all jurisdictions and various aspects of international economic law too. To carry out the study, it employs macro legal analysis, a methodology not previously applied in this field, as a means of developing an understanding of the legal frameworks that, it argues, influence corporate decision making that can affect human rights and the environment. It undertakes an analysis that incorporates relevant corporate law, World Trade Organisation (WTO) law, international investment law, the law relating to multilateral development banks (MDBs), and international insurance law. By using this form of anlaysis it is possible to show how legal frameworks can operate in unison, reinforcing each other providing a cumulative effect that can influence corporate decision makers. Finally, based on the results of the analysis, it suggests a possible strategy of macro-level reforms that could be applied to the re-design of relevant legal frameworks to better facilitate the full protection of human rights and to achieve net zero degradation of the environment. As a result it seeks to demonstrate how this approach can be strategically applied by both human rights and environmental lawyers as a common pathway towards effective legal reform. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business And Human Rights; Corporate Law; Corporate Responsibility; Csr; Environmental; Governance; Human Rights Due Diligence; International Economic Law; International Insurance Law; International Investment Law; Macro Legal Analysis; Multilateral Development Banks; Social; Wto Law; Business Development; Corporate Strategy; Decision Making; Environmental Degradation; Human Rights; Legislation,business development; corporate strategy; decision making; environmental degradation; human rights; legislation,,"Art and Craft of International Environmental Law, (2010); Environmental Law Review, (2012); Nickel, James W., Rethinking indivisibility: Towards a theory of supporting relations between human rights, Human Rights Quarterly, 30, 4, pp. 984-1001, (2008); de Andrade Corrêa, Fabiano, The Paris Agreement and Net-Zero Emissions: What Role for the Land-Sector?, Carbon and Climate Law Review, 15, 1, pp. 1-12, (2021); Turner, Stephen J., The Use of 'Macro' Legal Analysis in the Understanding and Development of Global Environmental Governance, Transnational Environmental Law, 6, 2, pp. 237-257, (2017); undefined, (1948); undefined; undefined; U N Doc A Conf 48 14 Rev, (1972); A Substantive Environmental Rightan Examination of the Legal Obligations of Decision Makers Towards the Environment, (2009)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119608958,

In 2017, the EU guidelines on non-financial reporting established that reporting climate-related information is part of the non-financial informa-tion. Later, in 2019, the guidelines were reinforced to include a supplement that envisages improving climate-related information reporting. Banks can contribute to reducing climate-related risks by supporting investments in economic activities that aim to mitigate the risk of climate change. Capital needs should be reoriented towards sustainable investment. Banks shall manage financial risks arising from climate change; therefore, they must integrate climate change into their policies and pro-cedures, assessing the potential impact of projects and financing on climate change. This study aimed to evaluate how banks in Portugal have been reporting climate-related information and whether the level of information has increased since 2017.

This is important especially in the era of sustainable non-life insurance promoting, among others, the use of ecological car engines or ecological systems of building heating. The fundamental issue in non-life insurance is to predict future claims (e.g., the aggregate value of claims or the number of claims for a single policy) in a heterogeneous portfolio of policies taking account of claim experience. For this purpose, the so-called credibility theory is used, which was initiated by the fundamental Bühlmann model modified to the Bühlmann–Straub model. Several modifications of the model have been proposed in the literature. One of them is the development of the relationship between the credibility models and statistical mixed models (e.g., linear mixed models) for longitudinal data. The article proposes the use of the parametric bootstrap algorithm to estimate measures of accuracy of the credibility predictor of the number of claims for a single policy taking into account new risk factors resulting from the emergence of green technologies on the considered market. The predictor is obtained for the model which belongs to the class of Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and which is a generalization of the Bülmann–Straub model. Additionally, the possibility of predicting the number of claims and the problem of the assessment of the prediction accuracy are presented based on a policy characterized by new green risk factor (hybrid motorcycle engine) not previously present in the portfolio.

Studies undertaken in 2007 and 2016 show that, at acquisition, the rating rose from 7th to 3rd most important attribute. This shift in priorities parallels the RICS embracing the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact (RICS, 2015). However, while sustainability value premia appear common in some international markets, the picture is mixed and drivers and mechanisms lack empirical investigation. The literature reveals potential barriers to investors fulfilling both sustainability and financial objectives. The purpose of this study is explore these potential barriers. Design/methodology/approach: Focus groups with real estate fund managers, sustainability managers and acquisitions surveyors are undertaken to explore the adoption and implementation of environmental sustainability policies. This reveals a series of barriers to implementation and these are then explored in greater depth through a series of interviews with fund managers. This layered, qualitative approach is designed to provide detailed knowledge of practical and conceptual sustainability issues within the UK real estate market. Findings: Key drivers underpinning the adoption of sustainability policies are revealed and barriers to implementation are found to relate to data on investment performance, valuation methodologies and prohibitive capex. Further, the heterogeneous, opaque and slow-moving nature of the market is prohibitive and intervention is encouraged to overcome the lack of financial viability that hinders improvements. Originality/value: Research is dominated by highly aggregated quantitative data on sustainability within commercial real estate markets. The qualitative approach used here adds new insights and value to the understanding of the embeddedness of sustainability in real estate investment decision-making. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Decision-making; Environmental Sustainability; Financial Viability; Investment; Real Estate,,Funding: This study was supported by the RICS Research Trust 495.,"Green to Gold Insight into Investment Attitudes Summer 2016, (2016); Sustainable Real Estate Investment Implementing the Paris Climate Agreement an Action Framework, (2016); Eres 2010 Proceedings, (2011); Sage Handbook of Mixed Methods in Social and Behavioral Research, (2010); Key Methods in Geography, (2016); Carbon Risk Integration in Corporate Strategies within the Real Estate Sector, (2019); Diaz, Julian, Multicultural examination of valuation behaviour, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 22, 4, pp. 339-346, (2004); McNamara, Paul, A green profession?

This fact, combined with deficient management of resources and waste, has led to the loss of biological diversity, compromising the generation of ecosystem services, with disastrous consequences for human health and well-being, but also for the economic system. In the field of civil engineering, the predominance of artificialisation and impermeabilization of cities (called “grey engineering”) is being questioned to be replaced or complemented with new types of infrastructures that represent a transformative change to achieving more sustainable cities. Through system dynamics applied to the economic modelling of the city of Santander (Spain), the aim of this study is to analyse the profitability of investment in ecosystem restoration and in both green and blue infrastructure, and of the implementation of environmental policies based on the relationships of affection established in the model, which represent the interactions between the main actors in urban dynamics. As a main conclusion, it is found that investing in green infrastructures and ecosystem restoration, and environmental policies is highly profitable: EUR 1 spent can produce up to EUR 100 as a benefit. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ecological Restoration; Green And Blue Infrastructure; Profitability Analysis; System Dynamics; Urban Modelling; Environmental Policy; Infrastructural Development; Investment; Policy Implementation; Profitability; Restoration Ecology; Sustainable Development; Urban Development; Article; Ecosystem Restoration; Human; Spain; Urban Area; City; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Cantabria; Santander [cantabria]; Cities; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Investments,environmental policy; infrastructural development; investment; policy implementation; profitability; restoration ecology; sustainable development; urban development; article; ecosystem restoration; human; Spain; urban area; city; ecosystem; environmental protection; Cantabria; Santander [Cantabria]; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Investments,Funding: This research was funded by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the grant RISKOADAPT (BIA 2017-89401-R).,"World Urbanization Prospects the 1996 Revision, (1998); Zhang, Xiaoling, Sustainable urbanization: a bi-dimensional matrix model, Journal of Cleaner Production, 134, pp. 425-433, (2016); Li, Feng, Urban ecological infrastructure based on ecosystem services:Status,problems and perspectives, Shengtai Xuebao, 34, 1, pp. 190-200, (2014); Wang, Rusong, Urban eco-complex and eco-space management, Shengtai Xuebao, 34, 1, pp. 1-11, (2014); Seto, Karen C., A meta-analysis of global urban land expansion, PLOS ONE, 6, 8, (2011); Elmqvist, Thomas, Benefits of restoring ecosystem services in urban areas, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 14, pp. 101-108, (2015); Steffen, Will L., Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing planet, Science, 347, 6223, (2015); Maes, Joachim, Nature-Based Solutions for Europe's Sustainable Development, Conservation Letters, 10, 1, pp. 121-124, (2017); Global Risks Report 2020, (2020); Living Planet Report 2018 Aiming Higher, (2018)",,MDPI,,16604601; 16617827,,,34682740.0,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117183191,

Amidst concerns of greenwashing, reliable sustainability assessment methods are needed to ensure that funds are channeled towards priority sectors for the transition to a low-carbon and more inclusive economy. This critical review provides a classification, analysis and evaluation of current sustainability measurement methods for investment funds from both industry and academia. The evaluation is based on a seven-criteria matrix, developed based on gaps identified in seminal academic works and in reports from international organizations. Following the evaluation, we find that carbon footprints and exposure metrics and environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings, while widely used, have several shortcomings, failing to capture the real-world sustainability impact of investments. We suggest that open-source, science-based and sustainability-driven assessment methods are prioritized going forward. Methods can be upgraded by incorporating measurement of positive impact creation and by adopting a life cycle perspective. Given the need to anchor sustainability assessments in the reality, the compatibility of investment products with science-based targets for sustainable development should become a central element of reporting requirements. Finally, methods incorporating a forward-looking perspective, as well as an assessment of investor's additionality are scarce and should be given priority in future research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Impact Assessment; Mutual Funds; Responsible Investing; Socially Responsible Investment; Sustainability; Sustainable Finance; Carbon Footprint; Economics; Life Cycle; Sustainable Development; Asset Managers; Critical Review; Financial Performance; Impact Assessments; Investment Funds; Mutual Funds; Responsible Investing; Socially Responsible Investments; Sustainability Assessment; Sustainable Finance; Investments,Carbon footprint; Economics; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Asset managers; Critical review; Financial performance; Impact assessments; Investment funds; Mutual funds; Responsible investing; Socially responsible investments; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable finance; Investments,"Funding text 1: We consider socially/sustainable responsible investment (SRI) funds as funds using ESG portfolio screenings, as well as engagement, with the final aim of having a long-term, positive sustainability impact. This definition combines literature- and practice-based definitions (Eurosif, 2018; Renneboog et al., 2008; UN PRI, 2018). Impact measurement in the context of sustainable investing can be defined as “the process of measuring and monitoring the amount of change created by an organization's or an investor's activities” (OECD, 2020a). Existing measurement and reporting tools do not reflect in totality the direct contribution of financial investments to sustainability goals (Busch et al., 2016; Kölbel et al., 2019; Schoenmaker and Schramade, 2018; Vörösmarty et al., 2018). Moreover, measurement tools are not consistent in methodology. For example, ESG scores from different providers diverge significantly (Berg et al., 2020), which muddles the signal such scores send to investors.Direct investor impact, also expressed through the concept of “additionality”, can be defined as the contribution of the investor, that would have not been achieved without his/her involvement (Brest and Born, 2013; Net-Zero Alliance, 2020; So and Staskevicius, 2015). SRI funds, through capital allocation choices and shareholder engagement, can send signals to corporations and influence the cost of capital of companies (Haigh and Hazelton, 2004; Kölbel et al., 2019; O'Rourke, 2003; Statman, 2000). Previous research stressed that more concentrated, actively managed portfolios and support for sustainability-related shareholder resolutions would allow investors to stimulate change (Boermans and Galema, 2019; Dimson et al., 2015; Dyck et al., 2019; Schoenmaker and Schramade, 2019; UN PRI, 2018). Accounting for investor's additionality could incentivize capital markets to play an active role in the sustainability transition. An investment fund that is actively managed in this way should be rewarded, compared to an investment fund that remains passive (IIGCC, 2020).The last family groups together methods and frameworks that aim either to measure sustainability as defined through the SDGs or focus on industry-specific indicators. Such tools overcome the centricity on GHG emissions. One framework, developed by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, measures impact across the SDGs by proposing a set of ideal and possible metrics to measure impact (CISL, 2019). Other methods, building on the extensive literature on industry sustainability indicators (Roca and Searcy, 2012), propose the use of industry-specific indicators to signal the exposure of portfolios (e.g. “fossil fuel reserve emissions” from the Trucost Carbon Scorecard model). Scholtens (2010) proposes a model to compute the environmental performance of governmental bond funds using diverse environmental indicators, like the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) developed by the Yale Center for Environmental Law. A later study extends this methodology by incorporating social indicators, namely the Human Development Index (Bilbao-Terol et al., 2014).In terms of reliability, the best practice is having open-source methodologies, that are ideally verified and tested, such as PACTA. Free-to-search ratings stand out through their value proposition – helping end investors choose sustainable options for their investments. We see this developing more and more, with MSCI offering open access to fund ratings (MSCI, 2020). In addition, sustainability certifications in the form of labels are an ideal way to prove sustainability. As current labels rarely demand mandatory enforcement of criteria, new labels, such as the EU Ecolabel for financial products will need to be more stringent in order to avoid greenwashing and promote funds with real impact. In order to be fully trustworthy, methods must incorporate reliable and complete data. Company-disclosed data can be complemented with estimated data points from scientific sources – which have the advantage of being “transparent, reproducible and peer-reviewed” (Vörösmarty et al., 2018).We thank Thomas Gibon, Claudio Petucco and Thomas Schaubroeck for their comments.

In this article, we review and synthesize existing academic research on risk exposure to acute and chronic climate-related events and forces and their impacts on property asset values and lending practices. Evidence to date is dominated by studies focused on residential property, although some recent research has begun to examine the commercial real estate sector in a more rigorous way. We draw inferences from the residential studies for how these findings might apply to commercial real estate and highlight the more recent studies focused on commercial property. Recent research is published within both real estate and broader economics and finance journals; these articles indicate that awareness of climate risks is having a more sustained impact on pricing and on investor decision making, although the channels through which impact occurs are generally opaque and warrant further research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,"This research was supported by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Climate Change initiative.

More theorisation and use of models would help avoid such omissions in future. There is firm evidence for the importance of some predictors: relevant skills; perceptions of response costs; building tenure; owner education; business sector, and business size. More qualitative and quantitative exploration is now needed to identify the factors that mediate these predictors and to establish the reasons for the inconsistent findings on the influence of hazard experience. Furthermore, evidence on the importance of other potentially important predictors is partial and fragmented – for example, social norms, social prompting and the concentration of clients in the area affected by a hazard event. More research also needs to be conducted in the Global South, where natural hazards have the greatest impact and the socio-cultural environment differs to that elsewhere.

The CO<inf>2</inf> emissions were tracked along with the extraction, distillation and conversion of the energy flow chain. The present results are based on real monitored data collected during the energy flow process from the oil fields to the refinery and lastly to the power plant. Its shown that to generate 1MWh electricity, 291 kg of Diesel fuel has to be burn, which in turn, 1141 kg of crude oil should be refined. The CO<inf>2</inf> flow chart has been drawn for this process, it found that the total CO<inf>2</inf> emissions are about 983 kg CO<inf>2</inf>/MWh, the share of oil industry sector which comes extraction and refinery are 0.97 and 5.43% respectively and the rest is from the electricity generation. The obtained results showed wide differences between CO<inf>2</inf> emission factors that were tabulated in inventories approved by many environmental agencies for all categories. Furthermore, the followed approach in this research has increased the CO<inf>2</inf> emission factors by 6.7% compared to the traditional approach and will give opportunities for fair competition for other electricity generation alternatives (such as renewable energy resources). This approach gives engineering and economic new dimensions to deal with the environmental issues, so that, the concept of optimization of engineering design can be applied from an environmental perspective.

An analysis of the work experience of pension funds in Thailand, Brazil, the United States, Norway and the South Africa allows us to conclude that the main areas of increasing social responsibility are to ensure decent and safe working conditions, environmental safety, absence of corruption and violation of the ethical and legal norms. It is proved that the subjects of the accumulative pension system should act on the basis of corporate governance and be guided by the OECD principles of corporate governance. According to the best foreign practices, improving the competence of pension fund employees is one of the main areas of the social responsibility. To determine the directions of increasing the social responsibility of the subjects of the accumulative pension system, an expert survey was conducted.

Analysis of publications of specialized international organizations, statistical data, and news releases has revealed that the financial sector holds a special place in the modern economy and therefore has to play a key role in confronting environmental challenges by mobilizing financial resources for sustainable activities, providing insurance coverage and helping to manage and hedge ESG-associated risks. However, despite the growing willingness of individuals to invest sustainably, institutional investors now face numerous difficulties when trying to respond to this shift in demand by adapting their investment strategies and offering specialized financial instruments. These difficulties include, among others, the lack of standardized definitions of sustainable activities and instruments; the voluntary and inconsistent nature of corporate ESG disclosure; the complex and long-term character of ESG-related risks. Digital technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, can contribute to elimination of these difficulties by identifying, collecting, standardizing, and analyzing the vast amounts of inconsistent ESG-related data in order to evaluate sustainability risks and to provide insights on a company's ESG performance even in the absence of standardized disclosure and at significantly reduced cost in comparison with manual research. However, digital technologies can themselves pose ESG-related risks, producing negative effects on environment, employment, inequality, and raising privacy concerns. It is therefore recommended that national authorities should not only promote the wider use of digital technologies in sustainable finance, but also set up legal frameworks to guard against the associated risks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Industry 4.0; Responsible Investment; Sustainable Finance,,,"Overview of Sustainable Finance, (2020); Capital Markets Innovation and the Fintech Landscape, (2016); Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, (2019); Policy and Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy AI, (2019); Global Financial Stability Report, (2019); Climate Change and the Financial Sector, (2020); A Status Report on Financial Institutions Experiences from Working with Green Non Green and Brown Financial Assets and A Potential Risk Differential, (2020); Overview of Environmental Risk Analysis by Financial Institutions, (2020); Finance and Inclusive Growth, (2015); Petrov, Maxim V., US financial power: Sources, mechanisms, limits, World Economy and International Relations, 63, 6, pp. 49-57, (2019)",,Springer International Publishing,,,9783030754044; 9783030754051,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164759397,

Companies must begin to rethink their business models and values to meet these new challenges. Given the process of intermediation, which has an indirect and catalytic impact, banks have a responsibility and opportunity to transform the economy by, for example, lending to projects that encourage decarbonization and/or green energy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the MagNet Hungarian Community Bank’s approach as a values-based bank in order to compare how the operation of the bank differs from that of traditional ones—even if these apply the Corporate Social Responsibility approach. The findings of an exploratory study of MagNet’s responsible and sustainable way of doing business can help other sectors and companies cope with the global crisis and be a part of the transition to an inclusive, fair, and decarbonised economy. The data for this study were collected using semi-structured interviews with eleven bankers and three customers of MagNet Bank in 2019, as well as bank documents. Using this information, we created a business model for the bank, using the Business Model Canvas method. Within the business model we highlighted how MagNet Bank integrates principles of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, with the aim of truly integrating sustainability into the core of their corporate genetic makeup, instead of as a partial or insincere measure. With the projection of the models onto each other, we emphasize the role of values in the business model. The combination of the models indicates potential learning points for the further development and long-term success of the bank and serves as an example of good practices for others. This is especially relevant when considering the greater need for improved crisis and risk management due to the pandemic and for the integration of sustainability considerations into business operations which have increased the impetus in the financial sector towards sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business Model Canvas; Financing Decarbonization; Hungary; Sustainable Finance; Values-based Banking; Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Conditions; Integrated Approach; Sustainability,business; corporate social responsibility; economic conditions; integrated approach; sustainability,This project has been funded with support from the European Commission.

In the context of international climate finance, the focus has been on mobilizing private finance for adaptation and in addressing barriers that prevent investments from materializing. In contrast, this article identifies options to engage the private sector in adaptation beyond finance and focuses on market imperfections instead of barriers. This moves the focus away from simply mobilizing more private adaptation finance towards identifying market forces that innovate, engage, and direct investments towards adaptation. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) and its portfolio of 74 adaptation projects serve as a case study. Two of these projects are categorized as private sector projects and an additional nine mobilize private co-finance or non-financial private contributions. Beyond these two indicators, we demonstrate that an additional 60 projects engage the private sector in other ways, thus indicating the important broader role of the private sector in adaptation. Furthermore, our ordinal regression demonstrates that by addressing the market imperfections of positive externalities, imperfect financial markets, and incomplete and/or asymmetric information, all have a significant positive effect on private sector engagement in the GCF’s adaptation portfolio. Both findings indicate that there is a large potential for the GCF—and other climate finance providers—to increase private sector engagement in adaptation. It must be noted, however, that the mobilization of private sector engagement in adaptation is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The main aim should be to adapt society as a whole in an efficient manner, including the most vulnerable groups and people. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation Finance; Green Climate Fund (gcf); Market Imperfections; Private Sector; Commerce; Asymmetric Information; Direct Investments; Market Forces; Ordinal Regression; Private Finance; Private Sectors; Private-sector Projects; Vulnerable Groups; Investments; Financial Provision; Innovation; Mobilization; Private Sector; Vulnerability,Commerce; Asymmetric information; Direct investments; Market forces; Ordinal regression; Private finance; Private sectors; Private-sector projects; Vulnerable groups; Investments; financial provision; innovation; mobilization; private sector; vulnerability,This work was supported by Bundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (Grant Number GZ: 414 K8187-0372/001).,"Action on Climate Today, (2019); African Development Report 11 the Role of the Private Sector in Africa S Economic Development, (2011); Private Sector Engagement in Adaptation to Climate Change Approaches to Managing Climate Risks, (2011); Journal of Sustainable Development, (2018); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, (2013); Averchenkova, Alina, Multinational and large national corporations and climate adaptation: are we asking the right questions?

The contamination rate and death cases are expeditiously increasing. Simultaneously, people are no longer relying on traditional news channels to enlighten themselves about the epidemic situation. Alternately, smart cities citizens are relying more on Social Network Service (SNS) to follow the latest news and information regarding the outbreak, share their opinions, and express their feelings and symptoms. In this paper, we propose an SNS Big Data Analysis Framework for COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction in Smart Sustainable Healthy City, where Twitter platform is adopted. Over 10000 Tweets were collected during two months, 38% of users aged between 18 and 29, while 26% are between 30 and 49 years old. 56% of them are males and 44% are females. The geospatial location is USA, and the used language is English. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is deployed to filter the tweets. Results demonstrated an outbreak cluster predicted seven days earlier than the confirmed cases with an indicator of 0.989. Analyzing data from SNS platforms enabled predicting future outbreaks several days earlier, and scientifically reduce the infection rate in a smart sustainable healthy city environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Big Data Analysis; Covid-19; Nlp; Smart Healthy City; Sns; Data Handling; Forecasting; Natural Language Processing Systems; Smart City; Social Networking (online); Tin; Analysis Frameworks; Big Data Analyse; Coronaviruses; Covid-19; Geospatial Location; Language Processing; Natural Languages; Service Platforms; Smart Healthy City; Social Network Services; Big Data; Data Set; Prediction; Smart City; Social Network; United States,Data handling; Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Smart city; Social networking (online); Tin; Analysis frameworks; Big data analyse; Coronaviruses; COVID-19; Geospatial location; Language processing; Natural languages; Service platforms; Smart healthy city; Social network services; Big data; data set; prediction; smart city; social network; United States,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) with a grant funded by the Korea government ( NRF-2019R1A2B5B01070416 ).,"WHO Announces Covid 19 Outbreak A Pandemic, (2020); Park, Jinho, A Comprehensive Survey on Core Technologies and Services for 5G Security: Taxonomies, Issues, and Solutions, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 11, (2021); Collection Methodology for Key Performance Indicators for Smart Sustainable Cities Cbd Eclac FAO ITU Undp Uneca Unece Unesco Un Environment Unep Fi Unfccc Un Habitat Unido Unu Egov Un Women and WMO, (2021); Das, Diganta, Pandemic in a smart city: Singapore’s COVID-19 management through technology & society, Urban Geography, 42, 3, pp. 408-416, (2021); Megahed, Naglaa Ali, Antivirus-built environment: Lessons learned from Covid-19 pandemic, Sustainable Cities and Society, 61, (2020); Badshah, Afzal, Smart security framework for educational institutions using internet of things (IoT), Computers, Materials and Continua, 61, 1, pp. 81-101, (2019); Singh, Sushil Kumar, OTS scheme based secure architecture for energy-efficient iot in edge infrastructure, Computers, Materials and Continua, 66, 3, pp. 2905-2922, (2021); Jha, Sudan K., Mitigating and monitoring smart city using internet of things, Computers, Materials and Continua, 65, 2, pp. 1059-1079, (2020); Ellis, David A., Do smartphone usage scales predict behavior?, International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 130, pp. 86-92, (2019); Brunborg, Geir Scott, Increase in time spent on social media is associated with modest increase in depression, conduct problems, and episodic heavy drinking, Journal of Adolescence, 74, pp. 201-209, (2019)",,Elsevier Ltd,,22106707,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105866607,

Various discussions espouse the positive impact of sustainable office buildings on business. However, previous studies only discussed the elements involved, but most of these discussions did not specify which element that significantly contributed to business objectives. Thus, this research attempts to discover the relationship between corporate real estate sustainable management (CRESM) and corporate sustainability (CS) objectives to determine the most significant element of CRESM influencing overall CS objectives. A questionnaire survey was carried out involving 117 combinations of corporate real estate managers who are directly involved in managing sustainable offices in Malaysia. Data was then analyzed using IBM SPSS Smart PLS. Results indicate six elements of CRESM significantly affect CS objectives that hope to assist corporate real estate managers to well manage their sustainable office buildings as well as contributing to achieve their business objectives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Real Estate Sustainable Management; Corporate Sustainable Objective; Relationship; Structural Equation Modeling; Sustainable Office Building Management,,I am grateful to Allah S.W.T for good health and wellbeing that were necessary to complete this research.

The Value Hill model of a circular economy provides a representation of the course followed by the value of an asset. Specifically, after the primary use, the life of an asset may be extended by going through four phases: the 4R phases (Re-use, Refurbish, Remanufacture and Recycle). Financial valuation allows us to quantify value creation from firms’ asset circularity under uncertainty, modelled by binomial trees. Furthermore, the 4R phases are valued as real options by applying no-arbitrage opportunity arguments. The major contribution of this paper is to provide a quantitative approach to the value of circularity in a general context that is adaptable to firms’ specific situations. This approach is also useful for translating relevant information for stakeholders and policy makers into something with economic and financial value. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Asset Valuation Models; Binomial Trees; Circular Economy; Investment Strategies; Real Options; Sustainable Development Goals; Detection Method; Economic Conditions; Farmers Attitude; Methodology; Policy Making; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Valuation,detection method; economic conditions; farmers attitude; methodology; policy making; stakeholder; sustainability; valuation,,"undefined; undefined; Principles for Responsible Investment an Investor Initiative in Partnership with Unep Finance Initiative and the Un Global Compact, (2018); Closing the Loop an Eu Action Plan for the Circular Economy, (2015); van Putten, Alexander B., Making real options really work, Harvard Business Review, 82, 12, pp. 134-150, (2004); Money Makes the World Go Round, (2016); Limits to Growth, (1972); Sauvé, Sébastien, Environmental sciences, sustainable development and circular economy: Alternative concepts for trans-disciplinary research, Environmental Development, 17, pp. 48-56, (2016); Entropy A New World View, (1980); Towards A Circular Economy A Zero Waste Programme for Europe, (2014)",,MDPI AG,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111146066,

We examined this question in the context of values-based financial institutions, which are amongst the most experienced institutions around the world in addressing the very real banking needs of enterprises and individuals within their communities. There is, indeed, an urgency today to have the banking industry consider its social impact in a holistic way. This paper expands our understanding of how these financial institutions, all members of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, define, design, implement, monitor and scale-up social impact. We used a multiple-case studies design to investigate their approach and inductive analysis to derive a model. From a theoretical perspective, we found that a social impact virtuous circular model best reflects how values-based financial institutions approach and practise social impact. Each step of the circular model clearly shows the way in which these institutions address and achieve social impact. Our findings have important implications for academic research focussed on understanding how finance can generate social impact. The findings of this article can, especially, also have practical implications for all types of financial institutions willing to improve the way in which they address social challenges and, ultimately, increase their social impact.

Financial institutions play a significant role in ensuring financial inclusion and sustainable economic growth and usually incorporate environmental and social considerations into their risk management systems. The results show that financial institutions with less capital risk, with lower management efficiency and with higher market risk usually make higher contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to their sustainability reports. The novel aspect of the present study is that it identifies the risk profile of financial institutions that incorporate sustainability into their business operations and measure the impact generated in the environment and in society.

Accordingly, the redirection of finance flows is a key objective of the Paris Agreement, and countries have started to enact policies to influence financial actors to this end. However, transparency on such policies is low, and it is hardly possible to compare policy activity internationally. To fill this gap, here we present a comparative analysis of green financial policy output in OECD countries from 2001 to 2019, based on a newly compiled inventory of 136 policies from 29 countries and the European Union. We show that policy output accelerated rapidly since the Paris Agreement, with countries implementing 3.3 policies on average using various governing resources. Key instruments include carbon disclosure requirements, low-carbon investment policies for public funds, and green state investment banks. However, there are huge differences in policy output between countries, and some countries that host important financial centers have implemented few policies to date. On the basis of our results, we develop a research agenda to deepen the understanding of this important but little-studied area of climate policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Finance; Climate Policy; Green Finance; Sustainable Finance; Carbon; Climate Change; Carbon Disclosures; Comparative Analysis; Dangerous Climate Changes; European Union; Investment Policies; Low-carbon Technologies; Oecd Countries; Research Agenda; Investments; Climate Change; Cmip; Comparative Study; Economic Policy; Environmental Policy; Investment; Mitigation; Oecd,Carbon; Climate change; Carbon disclosures; Comparative analysis; Dangerous climate changes; European union; Investment policies; Low-carbon technologies; OECD countries; Research agenda; Investments; climate change; CMIP; comparative study; economic policy; environmental policy; investment; mitigation; OECD,,"3fp Tracker 2019a Country Evaluation as of May 2019 Mdash; Paris Aligned Financial Market Regulation, (2019); Albrecht, Johan, Climate policy convergence in Europe: An assessment based on National Communications to the UNFCCC, Journal of European Public Policy, 12, 5, pp. 885-902, (2005); Ameli, Nadia, Climate finance and disclosure for institutional investors: why transparency is not enough, Climatic Change, 160, 4, pp. 565-589, (2020); Ameli, Nadia, Clean energy deployment: Addressing financing cost, Environmental Research Letters, 7, 3, (2012); Battiston, Stefano, Climate risks and financial stability, Journal of Financial Stability, 54, (2021); Battiston, Stefano, A climate stress-test of the financial system, Nature Climate Change, 7, 4, pp. 283-288, (2017); Bowen, Alex, An ‘equal effort’ approach to assessing the North–South climate finance gap, Climate Policy, 17, 2, pp. 231-245, (2017); Campiglio, Emanuele, Beyond carbon pricing: The role of banking and monetary policy in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy, Ecological Economics, 121, pp. 220-230, (2016); Campiglio, Emanuele, Climate change challenges for central banks and financial regulators, Nature Climate Change, 8, 6, pp. 462-468, (2018)",,IOP Publishing Ltd,,17489326,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110456309,

Two main interpretations dispute the goal’s reach, threatening its transformational potential. If left unresolved, the controversy may also mask trade-offs, allowing for unintentional harm to countries already vulnerable to climate change. Here we build on four methods to show that Art. 2.1(c) comprises a new meaning of ‘finance’ under the United Nations negotiations. In contrast to climate finance provision to developing countries (Art. 9), the climate consistency of finance flows represents a purpose that relies on support and action to transform the global financial system. Implementation of Art. 2.1(c) requires engagement by governments and non-state actors, including the financial sector. While solutions for Art. 2.1(c) will need to be adequate for countries’ contexts, accounting of trade-offs should ensure some level of convergence towards a global, timely and equitable progress towards climate consistency of finance flows. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Developing World; Environmental Economics; Finance; Global Perspective; United Nations,climate change; developing world; environmental economics; finance; global perspective; United Nations,"This work was financially supported by the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), with agreement GZ: 414 K8187-0372/001.

Still, we lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding of this emergent body of inquiry and a holistic agenda for future research. To address this gap, our integrative framework relates the key corporate governance actors to environmental sustainability outcomes from the extant literature and highlights its main methodological approaches and theoretical arguments. Our framework provides a critical analysis of what we know and points to the knowledge gaps around owners, boards of directors, CEOs, top management teams, and employees as corporate governance actors. We then highlight limitations in the existing literature as significant opportunities for further research to resolve its ambiguous conceptualizations of environmental sustainability constructs, various methodological and theoretical challenges, incomplete engagement with the global dimension of environmental sustainability, and limited analysis of how corporate governance actors may interact to shape environmental sustainability outcomes. We conclude by proposing novel approaches for addressing these issues, which we believe could generate a better way forward on studying the corporate governance of environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Boards Of Directors; Ceo; Corporate Governance; Employees; Environmental Sustainability; Ownership; Top Management Team,,"We are grateful for the partial funding from the research grants ECO2016-75909-P (Spanish Ministry of Science & Education) and PID2019-106725GB-I00 (Spanish Research Agency, 10.13039/501100011033).

The least developed countries and the small island states that lack financial resources to adapt to climate change are the most vulnerable nations to climate change. Although it would be more economical to adapt to climate change compared to the anticipated damage of not doing so, the demand for capital is estimated to range to hundreds of billions. The crucial question is how to manage investments to adapt to climate change globally. This study provides an overview of existing international provisions on climate finance for adaptation. It includes provisions through international financial institutions, United Nations agencies, bilateral and multilateral channels, and the private sector. It also explores how private sector finance can be further attracted to invest in climate change adaptation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Climate Change Adaptation; Climate Finance; Climate Resilient Economic Development; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Financial System; Global Climate; International Cooperation; Private Sector; Small Island State; United Nations,adaptive management; climate change; financial system; global climate; international cooperation; private sector; small island state; United Nations,"Funding text 1: The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) was conceived in 2008 and has been operational since 2012 (https://climatefundsupdate.org/the-funds/pilot-program-for-climate-resilience-2/ accessed on 30 September 2020). Its primary objective is to finance the preparation of climate-resilient national development plans. To achieve its objective, the PPCR provides financing for pilot and demonstration activities and capacity building to enable developing countries to build upon existing national work to integrate climate resilience into national and sectoral development plans. It also provides co-financing to public and private sector investments identified in national or sectoral development plans. Other eligible funding activities include enabling learning-by-doing and knowledge sharing at the country, regional, and global levels. It gives priority to highly vulnerable Least Developed Countries eligible for MDB concessional funds. The PPCR funding instruments include a grant to prepare the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience, a grant up to USD 1.5 million for the preparation of single country pilots, and grants and concessional loans for additional costs necessary to make a project climate-resilient. The World Bank Group is the trustee of the PPCR and all MDBs (except the European Investment Bank) are its implementation agencies. Since it began operations (July 2012), the PPCR has committed USD 985 million for 60 projects in 20 countries or regional groups of countries [14].; Funding text 2: 3.1.3. The Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) The World Bank Group (including the International Financial Corporation, the private sector wing of the World Bank Group) launched the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) in 2009 with funding from the European Union, and the governments of Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. (https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/industry_ext_ content/ifc_external_corporate_site/ accessed on 30 September 2020) The purpose of this index-based insurance facility is to protect smallholder farmers and micro-entrepreneurs against the catastrophic risks of natural disasters, which are expected to be exacerbating due to climate change. This insurance facility is one of the first innovative approaches to address climate change risks. It is different from traditional insurance services as it pays out benefits based on a pre-determined index or loss of assets and investments resulting from weather and catastrophic events, without requiring intermediating entities to assess the claims, thereby making the claims settlement process quicker. This facility also finances activities to promote the concept of innovative insurance solutions, capacity building, technical advice on products and pricing, and to encourage public policy dialogue and regulatory environment facilitation. The GIIF has facilitated more than 4.6 million contracts, with USD 730 million in sums insured, covering approximately 23 million people, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

African Water Facility (AWF) The African Water Facility (AWF) was established in 2004 to mobilize resources to finance water resources development activities in Africa. The main purpose of this fund is to support the equitable and sustainable management of water resources in Africa for economic growth, poverty alleviation, and regional cooperation. The African Development Bank (AfDB) is the implementation or administration agency of this fund. The fund is contributed to by multilateral financial institutions, foundations, and African governments. During the 2006–2018 period, it committed approximately GBP 162 million to 117 projects in 52 countries.; Funding text 3: Various UN organizations are either the source or implementation agency for climate change adaptation financing. The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the UNFCCC serve both roles. Other UN organizations, such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) serve more as implementation agencies of climate change adaptation financing. These institutes utilize different funds created under the UNFCCC (e.g., LDC Fund, Strategic Climate Fund, and Green Climate Fund) and the fund generated by the GEF. Other UN organizations, such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), also finance climate change adaptation activities. Below we briefly introduce these funds and institutions.","United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (1992); Climate Science Special Report Fourth National Climate Assessment, (2017); World Bank Group Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience, (2019); Lifelines the Resilient Infrastructure Opportunity, (2019); 2018 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks Climate Finance, (2019); Climate Finance Fundamentals 3climate Finance Thematic Briefing Adaptation Finance, (2019); Uk Aid for Combating Climate Change Eleventh Report of Session 20172019, (2019); Chambwera, Muyeye, Economics of adaptation, pp. 945-978, (2015); Investment and Financial Flows to Address Climate Change, (2007); Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change Synthesis Report, (2010)",,MDPI AG,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108203995,

Devastating phenomena like pandemics (Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDGs—Agenda 2030)), poverty (Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDGs—Agenda 2030)) as well as climate change (Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDGs—Agenda 2030)) threaten humanity, calling for more sustainable solutions. Although economic growth (Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDGs—Agenda 2030)) is one of the principal goals for a sustainable future, little research has been devoted to the interface of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability and their contribution to the financial sector, in view of sustainable banking. Even fewer are the studies concerning sustainable banking in Greece. This paper attempts a comparative overview of sustainability integration into businesses, focusing on the banking industry. The current theoretical analysis initially provides an extended review of the CSR and sustainability concepts, which is followed by a comprehensive analysis of non-financial disclosures (NFDs) and their business value, providing some evidence from Greece. The following sections refer to the performance implications and sustainability integration in the banking industry. Eventually, sustainable banking seems to enhance banking performance in a national business system. This is a very important deduction for sustainability to be both the cause and effect of corporate banking. Along with the discussion, some avenues for future research are highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Csr Commitment; Esg Performance; Financial Performance; Sustainability Reporting; Sustainable Banking; Banking; Financial System; Performance Assessment; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Theoretical Study; Greece,banking; financial system; performance assessment; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; theoretical study; Greece,,"World Commission on Environment and Development Our Common Future, (1987); Academy of Management Review, (1979); Mihelcic, James R., Sustainability Science and Engineering: The Emergence of a New Metadiscipline, Environmental Science and Technology, 37, 23, pp. 5314-5324, (2003); Business Ethics A European Review, (2009); Wu, Mengwen, Corporate social responsibility in the banking industry: Motives and financial performance, Journal of Banking and Finance, 37, 9, pp. 3529-3547, (2013); Sustainability Accounting and Accountability, (2007); Choices Matter 2005 Sustainability Report, (2005); Yoon, Yeosun, The effect of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities on companies with bad reputations, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 16, 4, pp. 377-390, (2006); Weber, Olaf, Incorporating sustainability criteria into credit risk management, Business Strategy and the Environment, 19, 1, pp. 39-50, (2010); Xiaoli, Nan, Consumer responses to corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives: Examining the role of brand-cause fit in cause-related marketing, Journal of Advertising, 36, 2, pp. 63-74, (2007)",,MDPI AG,,20711050,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107505702,

To date, however, there has been a failure to integrate accounting information systems with on-farm data, despite today's farmers facing unprecedented and interconnected economic and resource pressures. This study explores this problem in more detail, defines the objectives of the solution and develops a model of integrated accounting and agricultural information systems, drawing on a ‘fads and fashions’ framework and advancing our understanding of bundled innovations. Using data from a participatory case study in Australian potato farming, the study integrates accounting data with soil moisture and climate data to track, alert and inform irrigation decisions. Development of preliminary digital software based on the model demonstrates how cost-informed tracking, alerts and forecasting can be supported by bundling accounting information systems and sensing technology. In doing so, the model extends the fads and fashions framework for agricultural information systems and demonstrates how accounting information can be the key for improved water productivity, profitability and agricultural sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Decision-making; Bundled Innovations; Digital Information; Integrated Accounting Systems; Satellite Imagery; Sensors; Weather Stations,,The authors are grateful for the support of a University South Australia Research Themes Investment Scheme grant (2018).,"Emmanuel, Abioye Abiodun, A review on monitoring and advanced control strategies for precision irrigation, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 173, (2020); Academy of Management Review, (1991); Abrahamson, Eric, Management fashion, Academy of Management Review, 21, 1, pp. 254-285, (1996); International Journal of Management Concepts and Philosophy, (2017); Alcon, F., Forecasting deficit irrigation adoption using a mixed stakeholder assessment methodology, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 83, 1, pp. 183-193, (2014); Alewine, Hank C., How measurement framing and accounting information system evaluation mode influence environmental performance judgments, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 23, pp. 28-44, (2016); Ali, Md Hossain, Increasing water productivity in crop production-A synthesis, Agricultural Water Management, 95, 11, pp. 1201-1213, (2008); Anderson, Shannon W., Managing Costs and Cost Structure throughout the Value Chain: Research on Strategic Cost Management, Handbooks of Management Accounting Research, 2, pp. 481-506, (2006); Argilés-Bosch, Josep M., New opportunities for farm accounting, European Accounting Review, 10, 2, pp. 361-383, (2001); Arnott, David R., Decision support systems evolution: Framework, case study and research agenda, European Journal of Information Systems, 13, 4, pp. 247-259, (2004)",,Elsevier Inc.,,14670895,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103589570,

The SRI is expanding beyond specialised SRI funds and increasingly conventional pension funds are integrating firms with certain ESG criteria, in line with legitimacy-theory premises. This phenomenon raises the questions whether SRI and conventional portfolios are converging and whether SRI funds preserve their ethical essence. Using fund holdings and ESG-stock scores, we examine the inclusion level of ESG firms by UK conventional and SRI domestic equity pension funds, taking into account the investment in controversial (socially-sensitive) firms (i.e. related to tobacco, alcohol, or gambling industries, among others). We find that conventional funds consider the firms in which SRI funds invest to integrate ESG criteria. Nonetheless, SRI funds maintain larger ESG-firm standards, preserving the ethical purpose, and larger ESG standards in SRI funds do not affect performance. Our results also show that the ESG integration into conventional funds evolves over time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conventional Funds; Esg Integration; Mainstream Sri; Pension Funds; Portfolio Similarity; Integration; Philosophical Aspects; Conventional Fund; Environmental, Social, And Governance Integration; Investment Decisions; Investment Funds; Legitimacy Theories; Mainstream Social Responsible Investment; Pension Funds; Performance; Portfolio Similarity; Investments","Integration; Philosophical aspects; Conventional fund; Environmental, social, and governance integration; Investment decisions; Investment funds; Legitimacy theories; Mainstream social responsible investment; Pension funds; Performance; Portfolio similarity; Investments","This word was supported by Ibercaja and University of Zaragoza [ JIUZ-2020-SOC-02 ], Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and ERDF [ RTI2018-093483-B-I00 ] and Government of Aragon [ S38_17R ].","Anantharaman, Divya, Managerial risk taking incentives and corporate pension policy, Journal of Financial Economics, 111, 2, pp. 328-351, (2014); Organization Science, (1990); Aslaksen, Iulie, Ethical investment and the incentives for corporate environmental protection and social responsibility, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 10, 4, pp. 212-223, (2003); Revue Deconomie Financiere, (2006); Barnett, Michael L., Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 11, pp. 1101-1122, (2006); Bilbao-Terol, A., Hedonic evaluation of the SRI label of mutual funds using matching methodology, International Review of Financial Analysis, 52, pp. 213-227, (2017); Borgers, Arian C.T., Do social factors influence investment behavior and performance?

Pursuing the same, this research investigates the impact of information and communication technologies, economic growth, and financial development on carbon dioxide emissions by simultaneously testing the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in BRICS countries. In doing so, this study employs Methods of Moments - Quantile Regression, which confirms that the effects of the explanatory variables vary across different quantiles of carbon dioxide emissions. The overall results indicate that economic growth and financial development contribute to carbon dioxide emissions across all quantiles, while information and communication technologies significantly mitigate the level of carbon dioxide emissions only at lower emissions quantiles. Moreover, the results confirm the presence of the EKC hypothesis. Interestingly, the effect of economic growth and information and communication technologies on carbon dioxide emissions is lowest in magnitude at lower quantiles and highest at higher quantiles of carbon dioxide emissions. The empirical findings of DH panel heterogenous causality test confirm bidirectional causality between the model parameters, indicating that any policy intervention concerning explanatory variables significantly causes carbon dioxide emissions and vice versa.

This poses severe implications for the organizational efficiency, aid effectiveness and multilateralism of the UN. Reforms have not been able to stem the trend towards earmarked funding, raising the question of what explains the continued rise of earmarking in the United Nations Development System (UNDS). Purpose: This article aims to add a new perspective on earmarking, specifically in the UN. It tries to explain not the root causes of earmarking, but the dynamics of the significant rise over the last decade. The argument is that earmarking has been driven by three vicious circles: by the rational factors associated with a collective action breakdown, a change in norms of appropriateness, and institutional fragmentation. Approach and methods: The article draws on funding data from the UN, on 65 interviews with UN staff and donor representatives conducted in the context of a recent research project, and on document analysis. Special attention is given to two donors, Sweden and Germany, dedicated multilateralists that have increased their earmarked resources in recent years. Findings: Conventional explanations of earmarking in the UN—dissatisfaction with the performance of UN organizations, the desire for more accountability, policy differences with organizations—cannot fully explain the significant rise in earmarking over the last decade. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that the UN system has reached a tipping point, so that earmarking has become self-perpetuating. Policy implications: The findings put a question mark after the premises that have so far guided practical efforts by the UN and member states to reduce the share of earmarked funding. They suggest that more fundamental changes to rules and incentives are required to rebalance the UN’s funding towards core contributions. Four specific recommendations are derived from the analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Development; Earmarking; Un; Collective Action; Multilateral Trade; Policy Analysis; Trade Policy; Germany; Sweden,collective action; multilateral trade; policy analysis; trade policy; Germany; Sweden,This research was supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).,"Abbott, Kenneth W., Why states act through formal international organizations, Journal of Conflict Resolution, 42, 1, pp. 3-32, (1998); An Analysis of the Resource Mobilization Function within the United Nations System, (2014); New York Times, (2017); Alger, Chadwick F., The united states in the united nations, International Organization, 27, 1, pp. 1-23, (1973); Baumann, Max Otto, Forever North–South?

Current mechanisms that redress emissions are largely economic disincentives, in effect financial penalties for emitters. In order to attain Net Zero futures, financial incentives for activities that sequester carbon from the atmosphere are needed. Herein, we present the environmental and economic co-benefits of soil re-carbonization and justify support for soil carbon remuneration. With increasing momentum to develop green economies, and projected increases in carbon price, growth in the global carbon market is inevitable. The establishment of a soil-based carbon economy, within this emerging financial space, has the potential to deliver a paradigm shift that will accelerate climate change mitigation, and concurrently realize net gains for soil health and the delivery of soil ecosystem services. Pivotal to the emergence of a global soil carbon economy will be a consensus on certification instruments used for long-term soil carbon storage, and the development of robust institutional agreements and processes to facilitate soil carbon trading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Sequestration; Payment; Re-carbonization; Soil Carbon; Soil Carbon Economics; Soil Ecosystem Services,,"Data accessibility.

These plants are financed by banks and investors, which in many instances reside elsewhere. This paper examines the international dimension of coal financing from commercial banks and institutional investors based on a newly constructed dataset. We analyse domestic as well as cross-border financial flows and propose a methodology to calculate 'finance-based emissions' associated with the construction of coal-fired power plants. Our results indicate that financial institutions from the United States, Europe and Japan play a major role in financing coal plants globally, especially in terms of loans, bonds and equity investment.

The aim of the presented study is to identify the scope of activities of financial institutions in the field of sustainable development. What roles could banks have in contributing to sustainable development by offering socially responsible financial products? The authors conducted both quantitative research on a random group of Polish managers and a Delphi study on a group of several dozen experts, former members of the government, and bank presidents. The main results of the research indicate a 78% support among Polish managers for the activities of enterprises in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. More than 60% of the experts surveyed said that offering socially responsible financial products by banks is a growing trend in the economy. Moreover, two-thirds of the study’s participants think that such products are to be characterized by lower fees and margins than other standard financial products. Examples of the most frequently mentioned and expected products include those related to the development of green energy and eco-innovations or waste disposal. The results of the conducted research clearly indicate the need for financial institutions or banks to offer socially responsible financial products, which should become a part of their development strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bank; Corporate Social Responsibility; Ecology; Environment; Financial Market; Socially Responsible Financial Products; Sustainable Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Development Strategy; Financial Provision; Financial Services; Government; Institutional Framework; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Waste Disposal; Poland [central Europe],corporate social responsibility; development strategy; financial provision; financial services; government; institutional framework; sustainability; sustainable development; waste disposal; Poland [Central Europe],"Funding: This research was funded by the Collegium of Business Administration at Warsaw School of Economics, as part of funds for research and increasing scientific output.

The 3rd US National Climate Assessment pointed to a need for a system of indicators of climate and global change based on long-term data that could be used to support assessments and this led to the development of the National Climate Indicators System (NCIS). Here we identify a representative set of key atmospheric indicators of changes in atmospheric radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases (GHGs), and we evaluate atmospheric composition measurements, including non-CO<inf>2</inf> GHGs for use as climate change indicators in support of the US National Climate Assessment. GHG abundances and their changes over time can provide valuable information on the success of climate mitigation policies, as well as insights into possible carbon-climate feedback processes that may ultimately affect the success of those policies. To ensure that reliable information for assessing GHG emission changes can be provided on policy-relevant scales, expanded observational efforts are needed. Furthermore, the ability to detect trends resulting from changing emissions requires a commitment to supporting long-term observations. Long-term measurements of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and clouds and related climate indicators used with a dimming/brightening index could provide a foundation for quantifying forcing and its attribution and reducing error in existing indicators that do not account for complicated cloud processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Anthropogenic Emissions; Atmospheric Composition; Greenhouse Gases; Radiative Forcing; Atmospheric Composition; Atmospheric Radiation; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Climate Change Indicators; Climate Mitigations; Composition Measurements; Energy Balance Of The Earth; Long Term Observations; Long-term Measurements; Radiative Forcings; System Of Indicators; Climate Change; Biosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Energy Balance; Fossil Fuel; Greenhouse Gas; Long-term Change; Radiative Forcing,Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric radiation; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Climate change indicators; Climate mitigations; Composition measurements; Energy balance of the earth; Long term observations; Long-term measurements; Radiative forcings; System of indicators; Climate change; biosphere; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; energy balance; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; long-term change; radiative forcing,"Bruhwiler, Butler, Montzka, Dlugencky, and Stanitski are employed by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory.

Previous studies estimated that 30% of the region has been lost to agricultural conversion and we estimate here that 33% is allocated for mining concessions. For conservation planning, we used niche models for species endemic to the Albertine Rift and those that are globally threatened. We assessed where to conserve these species using three scenarios: (1) a baseline assuming equal conservation costs across all grid cells in the study area, (2) a scenario locking in existing protected areas (i.e. always selecting them by default) and assessing which unprotected areas require conservation, and (3) a scenario considering mining planned across the region. Marxan analyses produced similar results for the three scenarios, highlighting the importance of existing protected areas and the value of several community-managed or provincial protected areas in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The current protected area network covers 134,246 km2 and an additional 64,586 km2 would be required to ensure the conservation of all threatened and endemic species outside the parks and wildlife reserves. However, if trying to avoid mining concessions this increases to 145,704 km2, an area larger than the existing protected areas. Some mining concessions harbour species with a restricted range and would thus need to be protected to ensure the persistence of threatened and endemic fauna and flora. These mining concessions should be challenged by the conservation community. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Albertine Rift; Biodiversity; Conservation Planning; Marxan; Mining; Niche Models; Protected Areas; Agricultural Development; Anthropogenic Effect; Biodiversity; Conservation Planning; Endemic Species; Human Development Index; Mining; Nature Conservation; Nature Reserve; Scenario Analysis; Congo; East African Rift; Western Rift,agricultural development; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; conservation planning; endemic species; human development index; mining; nature conservation; nature reserve; scenario analysis; Congo; East African Rift; Western Rift,,"A Framework for Conservation in the Albertine Rift, (2004); Global Land Cover Map for 2009 Globcover 2009, (2012); Ayebare, Samuel, Conservation of the endemic species of the Albertine Rift under future climate change, Biological Conservation, 220, pp. 67-75, (2018); Spatial Conservation Prioritisation Quantitative Methods and Computational Tools, (2009); Biodiversity Offsets and the Mitigation Hierarchy A Review of Current Application in the Banking Sector, (2010); Bland, Lucie M., Predicting the conservation status of data-deficient species, Conservation Biology, 29, 1, pp. 250-259, (2015); Hotspots Revisited Earth S Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Ecoregions, (2004); Burgess, Neil M., Correlations among species distributions, human density and human infrastructure across the high biodiversity tropical mountains of Africa, Biological Conservation, 134, 2, pp. 164-177, (2007); Terrestrial Ecoregions of Africa and Madagascar A Conservation Assessment, (2004); Cordeiro, Norbert J., Conservation in areas of high population density in sub-Saharan Africa, Biological Conservation, 134, 2, pp. 155-163, (2007)",,Cambridge University Press,,00306053; 13653008,,ORYXA,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078405828,

To date, most business approaches have focused on sustainable marketing and corporate social responsibility initiatives. In this field study, we examine IKEA's Live Lagom project, a 3-year behaviour change initiative that aimed to explore how to go above and beyond conventional approaches demonstrating how businesses could support sustainable development by supporting their customers' attempts to live more sustainable lifestyles. We examined the effectiveness of the project involving multifaceted behaviour change interventions, testing for behavioural changes both during and after the project period. In addition, we explored changes in participants' attitudes towards the company. Findings show that the extensive set of interventions led to changes in pro-environmental behaviours across all three participant groups with potentially positive impacts on the customer–company relationship. The article thus provides a call for further businesses to engage in similar behaviour change projects that would allow citizens to engage in more sustainable lifestyles and behaviours across contexts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Behaviour Change; Ikea; Intervention; Pro-environmental Behaviour; Responsible Business; Retailer; Sustainable Lifestyles; Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmentalism; Lifestyle; Retailing; Sustainable Development,business; corporate social responsibility; environmentalism; lifestyle; retailing; sustainable development,,"Abrahamse, Wokje, The effect of tailored information, goal setting, and tailored feedback on household energy use, energy-related behaviors, and behavioral antecedents, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 27, 4, pp. 265-276, (2007); Abrahamse, Wokje, Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour: What works, what doesn’t, and why, pp. 1-184, (2019); Abrahamse, Wokje, A review of intervention studies aimed at household energy conservation, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 25, 3, pp. 273-291, (2005); Amel, Elise L., Beyond the roots of human inaction: Fostering collective effort toward ecosystem conservation, Science, 356, 6335, pp. 275-279, (2017); Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, (2002); Baumeister, Roy F., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 117, 3, pp. 497-529, (1995); Brulhart, Franck, Do Stakeholder Orientation and Environmental Proactivity Impact Firm Profitability?, Journal of Business Ethics, 158, 1, pp. 25-46, (2019); Calabrese, Armando, Fostering sustainability-oriented service innovation (SOSI) through business model renewal: The SOSI tool, Journal of Cleaner Production, 201, pp. 783-791, (2018); Carroll, Archie B., Corporate social responsibility: Evolution of a definitional construct, Business and Society, 38, 3, pp. 268-295, (1999); Clark, William C., Sustainability science: The emerging research program, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100, 14, pp. 8059-8061, (2003)",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,09644733; 10990836,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093655594,

The state’s impact on the quantity and quality of reporting practices is analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis is used to examine the volumes, frequency and content of sustainability disclosures by China’s financial institutions. Survival analysis is used to identify factors significant in firms’ initiation of these disclosures. In total, 308 firm-year observations on disclosures are examined for 2007–2016. Findings: China’s financial sector’s sustainability reporting pieces of evidence an “emerging stage” (2007–2009), “developing stage” (2010) and “greening stage” (2011–2016). The roles of institutional theory and regulatory pressure in explaining Chinese financial firms’ reporting behaviours are supported. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations. Firstly, given data restrictions, use of a relatively small sample size. Secondly, it examines different categories of disclosures made by financial firms, not more detailed content. Thirdly, is the potential overlap in disclosure themes under the classification scheme. Practical implications: China’s financial sector’s adoption of sustainability reporting has been institutionalized, mainly in its banking subsector, consistent with general regulatory pressures. Social implications: “Greening the finance system” is examined in China’s context, as the country transforms from a resource and pollution-intensive to a green economy. Originality/value: The financial sector is normally excluded from in-depth qualitative research. This study examines China’s financial sector’s responses to recent governmental pressures on green finance disclosures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Content Analysis; Financial Institutions; Green Finance Disclosures; Institutional Theory; Survival Analysis; Sustainability Reporting,,,"Alberici, Adalberto, The Quality of Disclosures on Environmental Policy: The Profile of Financial Intermediaries, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 23, 5, pp. 283-296, (2016); Andrikopoulos, Andreas, Corporate social responsibility reporting in financial institutions: Evidence from Euronext, Research in International Business and Finance, 32, pp. 27-35, (2014); Banking Financial Services Policy Report, (2012); Bouvain, Petra, Corporate social responsibility in financial services: A comparison of Chinese and East Asian banks vis-à-vis American banks, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 31, 6, pp. 420-439, (2013); Bradford, Marianne, Corporate sustainability reporting and stakeholder concerns: Is there a disconnect?, Accounting Horizons, 31, 1, pp. 83-102, (2017); Branco, Manuel Castelo, Communication of corporate social responsibility by Portuguese banks: A legitimacy theory perspective, Corporate Communications, 11, 3, pp. 232-248, (2006); Buallay, Amina Mohammed, Is sustainability reporting (ESG) associated with performance?

I argue that such heterogeneity may hinder the smooth development of the conceptual thinking underpinning sustainable finance and originates specific risks that may harm the credibility of the nascent market. These risks include green and sustainable washing, the rebranding of financial flows without addi-tionality, the disordered adjustment in the cost of capital spreads between industries. I argue that to reflect the actual industry and policy context as wells as to steer conceptual and applied practice sustainable finance should be today referred to as “finance for sustainability”. To this extent, both its definition and implementing standards should make clear reference to the relevant sustainability dimensions (in particular in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement) and to the sectors or activities that positively contribute to these dimensions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Greenwashing; Paris Agreement; Rebranding; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Finance; Sustainable Washing; Credit Provision; Environmental Assessment; Environmental Policy; Finance; Heterogeneity; International Agreement; Landscape Planning; Risk Assessment; Standard (regulation); Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal,credit provision; environmental assessment; environmental policy; finance; heterogeneity; international agreement; landscape planning; risk assessment; standard (regulation); sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal,,"Voluntary Process Guidelines for Issuing Green Bonds, (2021); Voluntary Process Guidelines for Issuing Social Bonds, (2020); Green Finance A Bottom Up Approach to Track Existing Flows, (2017); Definitions and Concepts Background Note, (2016); Action Plan Financing Sustainable Growth, (2018); Need for A Common Language in Green Finance, (2017); Business Ethics A European Review, (2001); Eccles, Neil Stuart, The Origins and Meanings of Names Describing Investment Practices that Integrate a Consideration of ESG Issues in the Academic Literature, Journal of Business Ethics, 104, 3, pp. 389-402, (2011); Opportunities and Challenges for Issuers Investors and Marketplaces, (2019); Friede, Gunnar, ESG and financial performance: aggregated evidence from more than 2000 empirical studies, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 5, 4, pp. 210-233, (2015)",,MDPI AG,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099606309,

The Case of Bradesco Bank in Brazil and Aseguradora Rural in Guatemala solves the distribution channel challenge. The former using pharmacies, bakeries, beauty salons as sales points, and through the use of mobile devices. The latter is a case of reducing premium cost of health insurance by focusing on claims payments, linking insurance policies with prevention treatments. In the case of the Mexican alliance between the biggest chain store in Mexico, OXXO, and the insurance company GNP, they used the 14,000 stores of OXXO to distribute an easy to understand insurance. In el Salvador, the insurance company Seguros Futuro fosters the insurance sales using risk management education. Finally, the case of PROFIN is an example of three kinds of insurance, agriculture, life, and property, in one single and easy to understand policy.

In order to achieve the 2-degree goal, green finance has a vital role to play. Mauritius, being a developing country is no exception to join the league and to promote the provision of green finance. Green finance is a financing instrument binding the green industries to the financial institutions with the objective to protect the environment. However, there has been scant literature on the development of green finance in developing countries. The chapter attempts to map the nexus between the provider of green finance by the commercial banks and the users of green finance in Mauritius while investigating their different green finance solutions proposed. Two surveys were administered to 200 individual customers and 50 businesses under the user’s category and to 15 banks in Mauritius as providers of green finance. The results show that green finance is still at its infancy stage with a low level of awareness and adoption of it. Providers are also ineffective in promoting it and it raises concerns over whether such finance is a priority for them. Individuals and businesses are interested in Green Finance as it fosters sustainable development; Green Finance also increases banks’ profits, enhances stakeholder engagement, and diversifies their product portfolio. The major barriers revealed by the study are lack of communication between banks and customers, inadequate enforcement and insufficient qualified staffs. Recommendations have been leveled at banks, Central Bank, and NGOs. A marketing mix has been designed to enhance the awareness and adoption of Green Finance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adoption; Awareness; Climate Change; Green Finance; Green Finance Initiatives; Green Finance Products; Satisfaction,,,"Arcury, Thomas A., Environmental worldview in response to environmental problems: Kentucky 1984 and 1988 Compared, Environment and Behavior, 22, 3, pp. 387-407, (1990); Financing A Green Future an Examination of Chinas Banking Sector for Green Finance, (2011); Bank of America Issues 1 Billion Green Bond, (2019); Taylor, D.

This chapter shows how financial inclusion, financial resilience, and climate change resilience are linked. The term “resilience” describes the adaptability of individuals, communities, and societies as a whole. “Financial inclusion” explains access to appropriate financial products and services for the public, while “financial resilience” describes the ability to meet urgent financial needs. Additionally, “climate change resilience” is a state in which an individual can successfully adapt despite environmental disturbances, stress, or adversity. This chapter draws a regulatory conceptual framework in understanding the nexus between financial inclusion, financial resilience, and climate change resilience. Existing literature confirms that financially integrated individuals are more financially resilient than those who are excluded. The findings of the extensive literature review also confirm that climate change resilience can be achieved through financial inclusion and financial resilience. Moreover, climate change resilience could be an inclusive solution against climatic and non-climatic stressors. Drawing examples from South Asian countries, we conclude that the inclusion of financial services enhances the resilience against the adverse effects of climate change.

These institutions do not tend to address climate change so much as an environmental issue, but as an economic one, a dynamic referred to as 'economisation'. Such economisation can have profound consequences for how environmental problems are addressed. This book explores how the G20, IMF, and OECD have addressed climate finance and fossil fuel subsidies, what factors have shaped their specific approaches, and the consequences of this economisation of climate change. Focusing on the international level, it is a valuable resource for graduate students, researchers, and policymakers in the fields of politics, political economy and environmental policy.

The Covid-19 has played the role of catalyst in the identification of socio-economic strategies suitable to preserve forms of 'sustainable development'. Therefore, there is need to respect, on the one side the ecosystem, on the other the dignity of person, whose fundamental rights have to be subjected to the evaluation of sustainability in the overall framework of available resources. In this context, the term finance assumes a specific meaning to reduce social imbalances and to restore the employment. As a result, it presents a close relationship with politics, so the perspective of a ""commutative justice"" that equally involves everyone to the benefits stemming from economics. The transition is founded on two pillars: a reforming eurocentric vision and the technological development which, through the digitalisation, fills the information asymmetries and avoids new risks to consumers. Indeed, the challenge of innovation needs a strong intervention of politics both from the European Union and Member States that are interested to ensure the fundamental rights and to address the social problems.

Issues of coordination among the Rome-based agencies, the World Bank, and CGIAR are discussed, given that the world is undergoverned in relation to the challenges of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, confronting climate change, conflict, natural resource degradation, income inequality, persistent poverty, and growing hunger. With greater long-term, core-funding support, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) would be able to translate its guidelines into operations to combat climate change and promote conservation agriculture and its Codex Alimentarius into food safety. With collaboration with the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Bank, FAO can help move fragile countries into rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development.

How does this development—along with our efforts to understand it—map onto environmental governance processes in China? While environmental issues have been increasingly important, the treatment of these issues in China reflects deep-seated governance processes that differ from parallel western processes in ways that have major consequences both for China’s domestic environmental governance practices and for Chinese practices “going abroad.” In China, institutionalized governance processes blur the distinction between the state and other actors; the “shadow of the state” is a major factor in all efforts to address environmental issues. In this setting, the space occupied by the nonstate actor community in western systems is being occupied by shi ye danwei (public service units), she hui tuanti (social associations), and e-platforms, all of which have close links to the state. At the same time, international NGOs and multinational corporations have also become significant players in China. As a result, the mechanisms of influence that produce effects in China differ in important ways from mechanisms familiar from the western experience. This conclusion has far-reaching implications for those seeking to address global environmental concerns, given the importance of China’s growing economy and burgeoning network of trade relationships. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Belt And Road Initiative; Environmental Governance; Nonstate Actors; She Hui Tuanti; Shi Ye Danwei,,,"Constructing Private Governance the Rise and Evolution of Forest Coffee and Fisheries Certification, (2014); A Systematic View of the Insurance Industry and Sustainable Development International Developments and Implications for China, (2015); New York Times, (2011); Business and Its Environment, (2000); Bartley, Tim, Looking behind the label: Global industries and the conscientious consumer, pp. 1-287, (2015); undefined; Sustainability Reporting Standards in China, (2016); Büthe, Tim, The new global rulers: The privatization of regulation in the world economy, pp. 1-301, (2011); Cashore, Benjamin W., Governing through markets: Forest certification and the emergence of non-state authority, pp. 1-327, (2004); undefined",,Palgrave Macmillan,,27306968; 27306976,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136722618,

Even where there are no direct implications for industry (yet), there is a series of subtle pressure points driving an increasing number of companies across the globe to work towards climate neutrality and pledging ambitious carbon reduction goals. This article sheds light on what the pressure points are, what the subtle triggers and what the underlying considerations, as well as hoped-for benefits of industrial companies to achieve decarbonisation. The observations and ideas presented in this paper are derived from quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data was collected within the framework of Energy Efficiency Index of German Industry (EEI). The qualitative data has been collected from interviews in industrial organisations and media documents as well as from professional practice. Not only societal, work force, supply chain and investor expectations play a large role, but also many strategic considerations which have the potential to make the business more resilient and profitable. Those companies that do not move towards decarbonisation on the other hand may face a costly late mover disadvantage. This piece uncovers subtle interconnections helping stakeholders from industry and beyond to grasp opportunities and challenges ahead. Taking account of these calls for rethinking economic viability calculations and investment decision making.

In western markets, companies issue environmental reports to lower information asymmetries and improve relations with non-state actors such as investors, buyers, and activists who directly reward or punish companies on the basis of environmental performance. In China, on the other hand, non-state actors have limited power to directly incentivize company behavior; hence, environmental reporting serves a largely symbolic function, to assure state actors of company compliance with environmental regulations and policies. Environmental reporting is one aspect of CSR Reporting that currently is required of some (but not all) publically listed companies by China’s stock market regulators. Our research shows that, currently, environmental CSR reporting and related company behaviors are narrowly aligned with Chinese government priorities to lower pollution and resource usage, neglecting other important environmental issues such as biodiversity. Nevertheless, efforts by third-party, non-state, standard-setting organizations are starting to widen the lens and improve both the quality and effectiveness of the reporting function. To a lesser extent, foreign buyers of Chinese stocks can also enhance the quality and impact of environmental CSR reporting, as can financial industry professionals who lobby stock market regulators to impose more stringent and effective rules. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Csr Reports; Environmental Reporting; Esg; Gri; Iso 14001; Iso 26000,,,"More than Values the Value Based Sustainability Reporting that Investors Want, (2019); Cfa Institute and Principles for Responsible Investment, (2019); Chen, Yichun, The effect of mandatory CSR disclosure on firm profitability and social externalities: Evidence from China, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 65, 1, pp. 169-190, (2018); New Law on Soil Pollution Will Pinpoint Responsibility, (2019); Corporate Social Responsibility Report, (2018); Eccles, Robert G., Corporate and integrated reporting: A functional perspective, pp. 156-171, (2017); undefined; Hofman, Peter S., Corporate Social Responsibility Under Authoritarian Capitalism: Dynamics and Prospects of State-Led and Society-Driven CSR, Business and Society, 56, 5, pp. 651-671, (2017); Hu, Yuanyuan, Ownership influence and CSR disclosure in China, Accounting Research Journal, 31, 1, pp. 8-21, (2018); Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Mapping Gap Analyses for Shanghai Stock Exchange, (2011)",,Palgrave Macmillan,,27306968; 27306976,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127914450,

Mayangkara Tanaman Industri, Jakarta, Indonesia","Tropical peatlands are highly important ecosystems for storage and cycling of carbon and water and for high biomass production and biodiversity. These processes are highly dynamic due to climate change and human activity, which can cause them to become highly vulnerable and irreversible. An “integrated monitoring, reporting, and verifying” (iMRV) system for tropical peatland has become an urgent issue for management, evaluation, and monitoring of peatland dynamics. Because the tropical peatland ecosystem is dynamic, the iMRV system must address the four elements of (1) water and carbon, (2) biomass production and biodiversity, (3) deforestation and forest degradation, and (4) climate change and human impact. The innovative new iMRV system must deliver (1) real-time and high frequency, (2) high resolution (less than 1 × 1 m), (3) high-number and wide-range spectral bands such as hypersensors and PALSAR (phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar), (4) 3-dimensional analysis, and (5) cost performance. Certain sensing/monitoring systems are available depending on the altitude from targeting fields: ground truth (monitoring), drone/unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and satellites. Finally, this work proposes the “international Equator observation system (iEOS)” composed of several sensing systems. However, in the future, the minimum unit should consist of hypersensors, PALSAR, 3D photogrammetry, and GHG sensors. iEOS is necessary because the Equator and the tropics are key features of Earth (planetary) boundary conservation, which is impacted by the most dynamic ecosystems and few sensing scenes unaffected by heavy clouds. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hisui (hyperspectral Imager Suite); Ieos (international Equator Observation System); Imrv (integrated Monitoring Reporting And Verifying); Palsar (phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar); Sar (synthetic Aperture Radar),,,"Burke, Claire, Optimizing observing strategies for monitoring animals using drone-mounted thermal infrared cameras, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 40, 2, pp. 439-467, (2019); Burke, Claire, Thermal-drones as a safe and reliable method for detecting subterranean peat fires, Drones, 3, 1, pp. 1-16, (2019); Fonstad, Mark A., Topographic structure from motion: A new development in photogrammetric measurement, Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 38, 4, pp. 421-430, (2013); Gumbricht, Thomas, Remote sensing to detect sub-surface peat fires and peat +fire scars in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, South African Journal of Science, 98, 7-8, pp. 351-358, (2002); Indonesia Japan Project for Development of Redd Implementation Mechanism, (2016); Harris, Angela, Hyperspectral remote sensing of peatland floristic gradients, Remote Sensing of Environment, 162, pp. 99-111, (2015); Hess, Laura Lorraine, Dual-season mapping of wetland inundation and vegetation for the central Amazon basin, Remote Sensing of Environment, 87, 4, pp. 404-428, (2003); Hirano, Takashi, Effects of disturbances on the carbon balance of tropical peat swamp forests, Global Change Biology, 18, 11, pp. 3410-3422, (2012); Hirose, Kazuyo, Contribution of hyperspectral applications to tropical peatland ecosystem monitoring, pp. 421-431, (2015); Hoyt, Alison M., Widespread subsidence and carbon emissions across Southeast Asian peatlands, Nature Geoscience, 13, 6, pp. 435-440, (2020)",,Springer Singapore,,,9789813346543; 9789813346536,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123772129,

Promoting and increasing investment in the renewable energy sector is crucial for limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C and addressing energy poverty in the Global South. In this volume, Avidan Kent explores the various home-country measures (HCMs) offered by international law that support FDI in the renewable energy sector. This book provides a bird’s eye evaluation of HCMs from fields such as trade law, investment law, environmental law, development law and more. It reveals that while international law indeed offers many legal tools to support investors’ needs, the current legal framework is fragmented; most legal instruments were designed in isolation and the potential for mutually supportive, synergetic policies has been explored only to a limited extent. This fragmented reality is in contradiction to the notion of Policy Coherence for Development, which is increasingly gaining support in leading institutions in Europe and elsewhere. This book will provide recommendations on the manner in which HCMs can be connected in order to maximise their potential and boost investment in renewable energies in the developing world.

We argue that one major obstacle to catalysing global excess savings at sufficient scale and speed on climate mitigation, and to ‘greening’ economic recovery packages, lies in the up-front risks of low-carbon investment. We then explain why public guarantees should be the preferred risk-sharing instrument to overcome that obstacle. We outline the basic principles of a multilateral sovereign guarantee mechanism able to maximize the leverage effect of public funds and massively redirect global savings towards low-carbon investments, with the double benefit of bridging the infrastructure investment gap in developing countries and reducing tension between developed and developing countries around accelerated funding for low-carbon transitions. We carry out numerical simulations demonstrating how the use of guarantees from AAA-rated sovereigns, calibrated on an agreed-upon ‘social value of carbon’, is compatible with public-budget constraints of developed countries. In summary, the use of such guarantee mechanisms provides a new form of ‘where flexibility’, which could turn real-world heterogeneity into a source of reciprocal gains for both developed and developing countries, and contribute to meeting the USD 100 billion + pledge of the Paris Agreement. Key Policy Insights: Catalysing excess world savings through low-carbon investments (LCIs) would secure a safer and fairer economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and avoid locking developing countries into carbon-intensive pathways. Public policy instruments focused on the creation of public guarantees can reduce the up-front financial risks associated with LCIs, mobilize private money and increase the leverage of public finance. A multi-sovereign guarantee mechanism would yield financial support from developed to developing countries in cash grant equivalent and equity inflows two to four times higher than the ‘USD 100 billion and more’ commitment of the Paris Agreement, and provide greater confidence in meeting this commitment equitably and effectively with benefits for all. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",100 Billion + Pledge; Climate Finance; De-risking; Low-carbon Investment; Post-covid Recovery; Public Guarantees; Carbon Emission; Covid-19; Developing World; Emission Control; Environmental Policy; Finance; Investment; Public Sector; Recovery Plan,carbon emission; COVID-19; developing world; emission control; environmental policy; finance; investment; public sector; recovery plan,,"Time is Right for an Infrastructure Push Www Document, (2014); undefined, (2015); Fiscal Policy After the Financial Crisis, (2011); Ameli, Nadia, Higher cost of finance exacerbates a climate investment trap in developing economies, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Blended Finance Evaluation Governance and Methodological Challenges, (2019); Andersson, Mats, Hedging climate risk, Financial Analysts Journal, 72, 3, pp. 13-32, (2016); Andrijevic, Marina, COVID-19 recovery funds dwarf clean energy investment needs, Science, 370, 6514, pp. 298-300, (2020); Arezki, Rabah, From global savings glut to financing infrastructure, Economic Policy, 32, 90, pp. 223-261, (2017); Blended Finance in the Poorest Countries the Need for A Better Approach, (2019); Innovations in Guarantees for Development, (2019)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,17527457; 14693062,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116321670,

The study proposes the Green Banking Adoption based on the Natural-Resource-Based View (NRBV) of the firm. The first-order constructs in the framework have been derived from the three green capabilities in NRBV of the firm. These reflective constructs lead towards the second-order construct of Green Banking Adoption. The proposed framework is developed and justified on a theoretical basis and through secondary data. This paper develops the second-order construct of Green Banking Adoption in congruence with the NRBV capabilities i.e. pollution prevention, product stewardship and sustainable development. The framework proposes a pathway for the adoption of Green Banking. The analysis and discussion are based on various examples of the adoption of the proposed indicators by existing Green Banks. This framework can serve as a benchmark for gauging a bank's progress along the Green Banking Adoption paths. The discussion reveals that the proposed green constructs can create a reflective relationship with Green Banking Adoption by undertaking a phase-wise adoption path.

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper adopts a two-step approach. First, this paper reviews existing “responsible” investment strategies and products used in practice and highlight their shortcomings in terms of optimising sustainable development outcomes. Second, drawing from the minimal standards theory, this study explores how emerging impact management practices may strengthen impact integrity in investment decision-making and mitigate shortcomings in existing “responsible” investment approaches to increase their contribution to sustainable development outcomes. Findings: Current “responsible” investment approaches often do not optimise sustainable development outcomes and may facilitate “impact washing”. The theoretically grounded framework demonstrates standardised impact management practices based on a bounded flexibility approach – adaptable to different contexts within limits and assessed by skilled analysts – along with incorporating shared language and conventions supported by appropriate accountability mechanisms that can be used to mitigate shortcomings in current “responsible” investment approaches. The authors further propose accountability mechanisms to systematically involve stakeholders (including rightsholders) in decisions that impact them with effective grievance and reparation mechanisms. Such an approach, the authors argue will strengthen impact integrity and the capacity of investments to optimise contributions to sustainable development outcomes. Practical implications: The findings have implications for the ability of investment markets to optimise their contributions to sustainable development and the SDGs. Social implications: By highlighting shortcomings in current “responsible” investment approaches and focussing on strengthening impact integrity in investment decision-making through standardised impact management practices, the findings enhance the capacity of investment markets to contribute positively to sustainable development and the SDGs. Originality/value: Despite its importance, impact integrity in investment decision-making is severely under-researched with little academic attention.

Climate action failure was the environmental risk most frequently listed in the top ten country risks. It also becomes a major reason that many companies are taking their own initiatives on climate change action which poses an imminent challenge for corporate governance as boards of directors track and assess such initiatives by their own companies. Boards can play a key role in guiding their organizations into the next new normal in the wake of global pandemic, economic disruptions, and ongoing climate change problems. This paper identifies and studies the corporate governance risks and opportunities related to global climate change risk and provides recommendations to boards of directors. The major sections of this paper are global climate change risks, corporate climate change pledges, climate-related financial disclosures, major topics in the Global Climate Change report, whether companies are ready to manage major climate change risks and opportunities, climate-related investment benchmarks, and conclusions.

Habitat loss, the creation of artificial environments, the manipulation and trade of wild animals and more generally the destruction of biodiversity are mainly affecting the dynamic balance of the biosphere, as is confirmed by the first world report on the world’s ecosystems, i.e. the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. The changes in the use of land and the destruction of natural habitats, such as tropical forests, may be the main origin of more than half of emergent zoonosis. Given the magnitude of the current health crisis and the potential of pandemic risks, the world needs to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time. As the current health crisis is turning worldwide interest on climate change there is an urgent need to assess the response to COVID-19 from the financial and insurance perspective. In doing this our analysis points out the relationship between pandemic risk and sustainable development by considering both negative and positive impacts on the achievement of the SDG 13 targets. The ongoing COVID-19 shows the urgent need to strengthen sustainability by reducing and managing climate and environmental risks that can be supported by radical solutions provided by sustainable finance, as the European Commission emphasized in its consultation on Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy. From the insurance industry view, it is clear that potential actions will be needed to limit the impacts of extreme weather events and related effects on global supply chain. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Covid-19; Finance; Insurance; Sustainable Development Goals,,,"Politiche Per Fronteggiare La Crisi Da Covid 19 E Realizzare Lagenda 2030 Policies to Fight the Covid 19 Crisis and Achieve the Agenda 2030, (2020); Barbier, Edward B., Sustainability and development after COVID-19, World Development, 135, (2020); Batie, Sandra S., Wicked problems and applied economics, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 90, 5, pp. 1176-1191, (2008); Covid 19 Interconnectedness Addressing the Crisis as A Good Steward, (2020); Corona Sustainability Compass, (2020); Camillus, John C., Strategy as a wicked problem, Harvard Business Review, 86, 5, pp. 98-130, (2008); A Catalyst for Change for Bank Branches Will the Covid 19 Pandemic Change the Shape of Bank Branch Networks, (2020); Addressing Climate as A Systemic Risk, (2020); Cernev, Tom, The importance of achieving foundational Sustainable Development Goals in reducing global risk, Futures, 115, (2020); Understanding the Sector Impact of Covid 19 Banking Financial Markets, (2020)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,21997381; 21997373,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107035622,

The broad definition of real estate used is examined through the lens of current challenges and foreseeable major change drivers. Critical realism and engaged scholarship are employed to consider a wide range of primary data generated from multiple practitioner engagement exercises. This process has revealed eight themes that relate to real estate in the 21st century: 1. Digital Disruption, 2. Health and Wellbeing, 3. Learning Environments, 4. Accessible and Affordable Housing, 5. Beyond Placemaking, 6. Resilience, 7. Infrastructure Interfaces, 8. Community Inclusion. The value proposition of this paper is to illustrate the relevance and contribution of project management to real estate and to consider the implications from the proposed set of eight highly relevant, cross-cutting themes. Within the six principal implications identified, we show how project management in the 21st century needs to be more strategically focused and front-end orientated on issues that have been considered beyond the domain of traditional, technocentric and execution-orientated project management. These six implications are presented within the context of two forms of real estatecontext: that real estate which already exists and that real estate yet to becreated.

Shareholder activism is a prevalent responsible investment strategy that is gradually gaining traction among South African investors. Aim: The primary objective was to gauge the views of selected local institutional investors on the nature of shareholder activism endeavours in South Africa. The secondary objective was to offer suggestions on the way forward for shareholder activism considering rapid technological development and the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: South Africa offers a well-developed framework for responsible investors. Given their substantial shareholding, institutional investors in particular have considerable power to influence the practices and policies of investee companies. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 representatives of local institutional investor organisations. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the primary data. Results: Interviewees mostly engaged in private with investee companies on corporate governance issues. They explained that more information is required to meaningfully engage on social and environmental considerations. Participants indicated that they consider and employ public activism mechanisms if private engagements are deemed unsuccessful. Conclusion: Technology will play an increasingly important role to enhance shareholder activism in future, but also offers various challenges. Although social media might be a valuable avenue to disclose information, it should be cautiously managed. Selective engagement details could be published on institutional investors’ and companies’ websites to enhance transparency regarding the nature and outcomes of engagements.

In seeking improved conservation outcomes across these tenures, we undertook a multidisciplinary review of the property law, conservation and environmental ethics literature. Our review revealed three major threats of property rights to conservation: a focus on tangible goods at the expense of intangible services, a focus on the plot rather than the land or seascape and a focus on rights over responsibilities. Our analysis reveals that overcoming these threats requires a blending of the construct of property with both ecological principles and social values. To this end, we offer a practical, solutions-focused approach that seeks to determine who has a responsibility, to whom they owe that responsibility and how that responsibility can be ascribed. This approach couples specific property rights with defined responsibilities owed to resource systems to support current and future beneficiaries. A formal recognition of the responsibilities that accompany rights can set the baseline of what society should be able to expect from rights-holders. From this baseline, policy instruments can be more appropriately applied, supporting landholders in their responsibilities and where necessary, providing compensation for activities that extend beyond their responsibilities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Duties; Ecosystem Services; Spatial Scale; Stewardship; Temporal Scale,,,"Adams, Vanessa M., Security and equity of conservation covenants: Contradictions of private protected area policies in Australia, Land Use Policy, 30, 1, pp. 114-119, (2013); Addison, Prue Frances Elizabeth, Using conservation science to advance corporate biodiversity accountability, Conservation Biology, 33, 2, pp. 307-318, (2019); Addison, Prue Frances Elizabeth, Bringing sustainability to life: A framework to guide biodiversity indicator development for business performance management, Business Strategy and the Environment, 29, 8, pp. 3303-3313, (2020); Commodity and Propriety Competing Visions of Property in American Legal Thought 1776 1970, (1997); Property Rights and Sustainability the Evolution of Property Rights to Meet Ecological Challenges, (2011); Bagstad, Kenneth J., From theoretical to actual ecosystem services: Mapping beneficiaries and spatial flows in ecosystem service assessments, Ecology and Society, 19, 2, (2014); Barritt, Emily, Conceptualising stewardship in environmental law, Journal of Environmental Law, 26, 1, pp. 1-23, (2014); Bartel, Robyn L., Property and place attachment: a legal geographical analysis of biodiversity law reform in New South Wales, Geographical Research, 54, 3, pp. 267-284, (2016); Australian Property Lj, (2009); Uc Davis Law Review, (2012)",,Wiley-Blackwell,,1755263X,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090552170,

However, the observed level of adaptation is insufficient from an economic perspective. We address this puzzle by adding a psychological perspective to explain actors’ behaviour. Based on existing meta-analytic evidence we discuss micro- (i.e. individual-), meso- (i.e. group-) and macro- (i.e. society-) level factors that may contribute to more engagement in adaptation and provide recommendations on how to address them. The results show that the strongest predictors of individual adaptation behaviour are people's beliefs whether adaptive actions will be effective in protecting them from climate-related hazards (outcome expectancy), the degree to which people believe that they are able to engage in adaptive actions (self-efficacy) and their emotional reaction to climate change. Equally strong on a meso-level are behavioural norms and cultural aspects on a macro-level. We recommend that decision-makers create more transparency about the cause–effect chain between adaptation activity and desired adaptation effects to strengthen individuals’ sense of efficacy. Furthermore, inducing reflection on social norms through communicative interventions may contribute to motivate adaptive actions by individuals and organisations. Key policy insights Psychological factors play an important but underestimated role in explaining adaptation behaviour. If people believe that they can address the risks of climate-related hazards they will show stronger adaptation behaviour. This insight can be used to incentivise more investments in adaptation. Social norms and cultural values are linked to adaptation behaviour. Public communication campaigns and other policy interventions can help to change social norms, and they should be tailored to the cultural values of societies. The influence of social norms and cultural values can be stronger than individual-level variables such as beliefs and preferences. People underestimate the extent to which others are willing to contribute to society, in particular in societies scoring high on individualism and masculinity. This can prevent people from investing in adaptation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Beliefs; Culture; Norms; Psychology; Review; Self-efficacy; Adaptation; Climate Change; Cultural Tradition; Psychology; Public Goods,adaptation; climate change; cultural tradition; psychology; public goods,"This work was supported by Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany: [Grant Number GZ: 414 K8187-0372/001].","Adger, W.

E&S issues that are important in terms of adaptation to a changing business environment) are integrated in the banking sector. Despite banks’ key role in steering financial flows towards sustainable development, little is currently known as to whether and how banks integrate E&S aspects into their management control systems and whether this integration translates into E&S performance. Building on prior studies in the environmental management control literature, we design a conceptual model in which we link contextual factors, a proactive strategy approach, E&S management controls, and E&S performance. Following common practice in the banking sector, we differentiate between two paths of E&S management controls: risk management (value protection) and topic management (value creation). Based on survey data for a small sample of 50 European banks, we find evidence that contextual factors, reflected in the perceived power and legitimacy of clients, voluntary standard setters and NGOs, are positively related to a proactive strategy approach. This proactive strategy translates into both topic and risk management. Yet, in the next step, only topic management is positively related to the E&S performance of a bank, but not risk management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Management Control System (emcs); Environmental Performance; Proactive Strategy; Questionnaire Survey; Social And Environmental Accounting (sea); Value Creation,,"We thank two anonymous reviewers and the editors, Nathan Lael Joseph and Alan Lowe, for their constructive feedback that substantially improved the article.

Whilst the RI sector is growing, there is limited understanding of the extent to which pressing social issues, such as obesity and unhealthy population diets, are incorporated within RI decision making. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which obesity prevention and population nutrition are considered by Australian institutional investors engaged in responsible investment. Methods: A desk-based review was conducted of investment approaches of prominent Australian asset managers and superannuation funds identified as engaged in responsible investment. Relevant information on the incorporation of ESG issues related to obesity and population nutrition was extracted for each investor, drawing on websites, published policy documents and annual reports. Strategies were categorized as: (1) negative/exclusionary screening; (2) positive/best-in-class screening; (3) norms-based screening; (4) ESG integration; (5) sustainability-themed investing; (6) impact/community investing; and (7) corporate engagement and shareholder action. These strategies were compared across investors and by themes related to obesity and population nutrition. Results: Eighteen of the 35 investors indicated that they applied investment strategies that considered issues related to obesity and population nutrition. The most commonly identified strategy was ESG integration (n = 12), followed by sustainability-themed investing (n = 6), and positive screening (n = 4). The ways in which obesity and population nutrition were considered as part of these approaches included relatively high-level general health considerations (n = 12), considerations around the healthiness of food company product portfolios (n = 10), and consideration of specific company nutrition policies and practices (n = 4). The specificity and depth to which RI strategies were disclosed varied. Conclusion: There is significant potential for investment decisions to contribute to efforts to address key social issues, such as obesity and unhealthy diets. Some institutional investors in Australia have recognized the potential importance of incorporating obesity- and population nutrition-related issues into decision-making processes. However, the extent to which these considerations translate into investment decisions and their impact on companies in the food sector warrant further exploration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Accountability; Corporate Practices; Obesity Prevention; Population Nutrition; Responsible Investment; Sustainable Finance,,"Funding text 1: ER is funded through an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.

Yet despite clear signals, we are slow to act in a meaningful way, despite the fact that we have the legal, political, and technological tools to transition our economies to net zero carbon. While some businesses are reluctant to take significant steps to reduce their carbon footprint, many companies are well-intentioned but feel somewhat paralysed in the face of overwhelming data that portend a financially and environmentally devastating future. Yet we can still reverse the trajectory of climate change, but it requires bold and informed action to reduce our carbon footprint in a manner that embeds fairness in the transition. This book offers a guide for companies, pension funds, asset managers, and other institutional investors to commence the legal, governance, and financial strategies needed for effective climate mitigation and adaptation, and to help distribute the economic benefits of these actions to their stakeholders. It takes the reader from ideas to action, from first steps to a more meaningful contribution to the move towards a ‘climate positive’ circular economy. It can also serve as a helpful guide to everyone implicated in a corporation’s activities-employees, pensioners, consumers, banks and other lenders, policy-makers, and community members.

These issues can have positive or negative impacts, whether for their employees, consumers, or communities. In times of crisis, the issues of human rights in business are even more acute − as the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, already having a dramatic impact on people across many supply chains. While the perception that states are responsible for human rights broadly prevails, businesses increasingly face growing expectations to assess, address, and remedy the negative impacts of their activities. Furthermore, developments in the past decade demonstrate the evolution of such expectations into legal requirements and mandatory regulation. States have employed various tools to influence business activities in this field, ranging from soft law to legal requirements both at national and international levels. This article analyses the main European trends of such an evolution within the selected areas of due diligence, non-financial reporting, and investment, and delves into recent developments from the perspective of benefits for business. It explores if the perceived benefits for businesses exclusively serve as a ‘stick’ that requires compliance, or whether they might extend beyond this. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business And Human Rights; Business Impact; Due Diligence; National Action Plans; Un Guiding Principles,,,"Draft Pan African Investment Code, (2016); Research Report 2019 an Analysis of the Sustainability Reports of 1000 Companies Pursuant to the Eu Non Financial Reporting Directive, (2019); Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, (2020); Good Business the Economic Case for Protecting Human Rights, (2018); Barrientos, Stephanie Ware, Do workers benefit from ethical trade?

Furthermore, we discuss approaches on how insurers can deal with these sustainability risks and opportunities, and provide selected empirical insight from the literature and (industry) surveys on current practices mostly for the European market. Our study emphasizes that while climate change represents an important factor in this context, it is by far not the only one. Insurers should thus take a broader approach on managing sustainability risks and opportunities.

Whilst these projects offer clear benefits, they are not without their socio-ecological impacts. An added feature of hydropower projects is that they tend to involve a wide range of actors that are responsible for their financing, planning, construction and operation (international and domestic; private and State). This begs the question, if it is ultimately the responsibility of States to ensure that these projects are in accordance with international law obligations, what does that responsibility entail when much of the activity is conducted by private companies? International law has a long tradition of placing States under an obligation to regulate the conduct of non-State activities so as to prevent transboundary harm. However, a closer review of the law relating to transboundary hydropower projects reveals that more could be done to guide States as to the appropriate measures that they might put in place to ensure that any hydropower projects involving private actors are implemented in an equitable and sustainable manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Due Diligence; Human Rights; Hydropower; Private Companies; Transboundary Harm; Fossil Fuel; Hydroelectric Power; International Law; Planning Practice; Private Sector; Project Assessment; Regulatory Approach; Sustainable Development; Transboundary Cooperation,fossil fuel; hydroelectric power; international law; planning practice; private sector; project assessment; regulatory approach; sustainable development; transboundary cooperation,,"Boyle, Alan E., Globalising environmental liability: The interplay of national and international law, Journal of Environmental Law, 17, 1, pp. 3-26, (2005); Buchan, Russell, Cyberspace, non-state actors and the obligation to prevent transboundary harm, Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 21, 3, pp. 429-453, (2016); Extraterritoriality of the Human Right to Water in International Water Law, (2013); Contreras, Gabriela, Self-regulation in sustainable finance: The adoption of the Equator Principles, World Development, 122, pp. 306-324, (2019); Dascalopoulou-Livada, Phani, The Kiev Civil Liability Protocol and the Interaction between Civil and Administrative Liability Regimes, International Community Law Review, 19, 4-5, pp. 518-550, (2017); Equator Principles, (2019); Follow Up Statement Concerning the Specific Instance Complaint that Andritz Hydro Gmbh Contribute to Human Rights Abuses and Environmental Damage in Connection to the Xayaburi Hydropower Project in Lao Pdr, (2018); Benefit Sharing in Dam Projects on Shared Rivers, (2012); Hoes, Olivier A.C., Systematic high-resolution assessment of global hydropower potential, PLOS ONE, 12, 2, (2017); Unep Finance Initiative, (2019)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,15679764; 15731553,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091381529,

A key theme in the water footprint literature is the efficient allocation of water resources at the global scale given the feasibility of trading water intensive commodities from water rich to water poor areas: this is an economic problem of resource allocation between alternative and competing demands, albeit with a novel international component. Moreover, given that price signals indicating relative scarcity are usually either absent or distorted for water, it is also a problem that can be seen through the lens of environmental (or non-market) valuation. However, to date environmental valuation has not been used to inform the efficient use and allocation of water within and between the different locations encompassed by international supply chains. Methods: Drawing on an agri-food supply chain framework that we propose in this paper, we begin by conceptualising the economic values that accrue to water consumption (blue and green water) and degradation (grey water) at different points along a supply chain. Based on this conceptualisation, we assess the extent to which it is possible to approximate these economic values by relying on existing secondary data on the shadow value of water in different contexts. The use of secondary data in this way is known as benefit (or value) transfer. To achieve this, 706 unit estimates of the economic value of water are collected, standardised and reviewed encompassing off-stream water applications (agriculture, industry and municipal) and in-stream ecosystem services (waste assimilation, wildlife habitat, recreation, hydrological functions and passive uses). From this, a proposed methodology for valuing virtual water is presented and illustrated using the case study of global durum wheat pasta production. Results: The case study shows the total value of the virtual water used to produce one tonne of durum wheat pasta ($212). More importantly, the case study also highlights how variations in economic value between multiple locations where durum wheat is cultivated (Saskatchewan $0.10 m3, Arizona $0.08 m3 and Baja California $0.24 m3) indicate relative water scarcity and thus impact, as well as the potential for a more efficient allocation of virtual water. Conclusions: The main conclusion from this research is that when geographical disparities in the economic value of water use within a supply chain are accounted for, what was perhaps considered sustainable in volume terms, might not, in fact, represent the optimal allocation. However, future research opportunities highlight the need for additional data collection on the economic value of water in several contexts. This additional data would help the environmental valuation community to undertake a more comprehensive and robust approach to virtual water valuation.

We discuss why MSCI chose to continue with the financial value–oriented methodology of Innovest while discontinuing the values-driven KLD methodology. Through an in-depth literature analysis, we further show that not only the creation but also the use of “nonfinancial performance” concepts rely on processes of social construction. We also show that investors use different ESG data from those used by academics, potentially leading to misaligned narratives. Finally, with this article we join the call for more explicit contextualization of ESG data, highlighting that both practitioners and academics need to better understand the social construction that underlies analyses that use different concepts of ESG. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg; Materiality; Nonfinancial Data; Social Construction; Sustainable Investing; Governance Approach; Innovation; Investment; Social Behavior; Social Construction; Sustainable Development,governance approach; innovation; investment; social behavior; social construction; sustainable development,,"Acito, Andrew A., Materiality decisions and the correction of accounting errors, Accounting Review, 84, 3, pp. 659-688, (2009); Social Responsibility in Capital Markets A Review and Framework of Theory and Empirical Evidence, (2018); Total Societal Impact A New Lens for Strategy, (2017); Social Construction of Reality, (1966); Beunza, Daniel, Performative Work: Bridging Performativity and Institutional Theory in the Responsible Investment Field, Organization Studies, 40, 4, pp. 515-543, (2019); Bowen, Frances E., After greenwashing: Symbolic corporate environmentalism and society, pp. 1-295, (2010); Ranking of the Rankings, (2016); Burchell, Stuart, The roles of accounting in organizations and society, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 5, 1, pp. 5-27, (1980); Laws of the Markets, (1998); Callon, Michel, What Does It Mean to Say That Economics Is Performative?, pp. 311-357, (2020)",,SAGE Publications Inc. claims@sagepub.com,,10860266; 15527417,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075401669,

This is a challenge for both companies and victims since comprehensive company-based grievance mechanisms (CGM) are currently missing. In this paper, we explore how companies can provide effective remediation after human rights violations. Accordingly, we critically assess two different approaches to conflict resolution, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and restorative justice (RJ), for their potential to provide dialogue-based, non-judicial remediation. We argue that remedy through agreement-driven ADR mechanisms risks marginalizing the interests and concerns of victims and affected community members, particularly in weak institutional contexts. Hence, we develop a dialogue-driven framework for corporate remediation of human rights violations grounded on RJ principles. This restorative framework provides a comprehensive CGM that focuses on the harms and needs of victims and aims at restoring justice through restorative dialogue. Based on a prompt discovery and a thorough investigation of the grievance, companies should design and prepare the remediation process together with victims, offenders and affected community members. Through restorative dialogue with the affected parties about the circumstances and impacts of the wrongdoing, companies can repair the harm, regain legitimacy amongst stakeholders as well as transform their business practices to avoid future human rights violations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business And Human Rights; Company-based Grievance Mechanism; Remedy; Restorative Justice; Stakeholder Engagement,,,"Arnold, Denis G., Transnational corporations and the duty to respect basic human rights, Business Ethics Quarterly, 20, 3, pp. 371-399, (2010); Balaton-Chrimes, Samantha, The Depoliticisation of Accountability Processes for Land-Based Grievances, and the IFC CAO, Global Policy, 6, 4, pp. 446-454, (2015); Corporate Accountability Research, (2016); Balaton-Chrimes, Samantha, Redress and Corporate Human Rights Harms: An Analysis of New Governance and the POSCO Odisha Project, Globalizations, 14, 4, pp. 596-610, (2017); Baumann-Pauly, Dorothée, Business and human rights, pp. 1-329, (2016); Baumann-Pauly, Dorothée, Industry-Specific Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives That Govern Corporate Human Rights Standards: Legitimacy assessments of the Fair Labor Association and the Global Network Initiative, Journal of Business Ethics, 143, 4, pp. 771-787, (2017); Private Dispute Resolution in International Business Negotiation Mediation Arbitration, (2006); Bertels, Stephanie, A responsive approach to organizational misconduct: Rehabilitation, reintegration, and the reduction of reoffense, Business Ethics Quarterly, 24, 3, pp. 343-370, (2014); Restorative Justice and Responsive Regulation, (2002); Harvard International Law Journal, (2016)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,01674544; 15730697,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064231358,

The international EbA South project implemented EbA interventions across three countries (Mauritania, Nepal, the Seychelles), piloting the restoration of mountain, desert and coastal ecosystems to enhance the climate resilience of local communities. The experiences of the EbA South project across these distinct ecosystems and socio-economic environments provide unique insights into the adaptive management invariably required within EbA initiatives. This analysis also provides lessons on how to share knowledge among different stakeholders and countries to advance South-South cooperation. Summary: Climate change is having an increasingly negative impact on the world's most vulnerable societies. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) uses biodiversity and ecosystem services to help local communities adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. This approach, which has the potential to be implemented across a wide range of ecosystem types and scales, is increasingly being adopted by governments and international donors within climate change adaptation initiatives. The objective of the EbA South project was to enhance the climate resilience of communities in Mauritania, Nepal, and the Seychelles by building institutional capacity, mobilizing knowledge and transferring EbA technologies based on China's experience in successfully implementing restoration. The project implemented EbA interventions in the drylands of Mauritania, Himalayan forests in Nepal, and the coastal zone of the Seychelles. All interventions were carefully monitored by researchers to generate scientific evidence of the impacts of EbA. Here, we provide implementers of EbA with the major lessons learned from the EbA South project, namely: (a) quantifying the full suite of ecosystem goods and services generated through EbA at a landscape scale; (b) budgeting in advance for management of time-consuming complexities related to socioeconomics and ecology such as land-use conflict, ineffective government structures, disagreements regarding intervention options, and challenging environmental conditions; (c) undertaking long-term research for adaptive management and documenting the project's successes; (d) providing platforms for effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders with different first languages; and (e) regularly adjusting exit strategies for maintenance of the EbA landscapes after closure of the project. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Eba South; Exit Strategy; Long-term Research; Project Management; Restoration; South-south Cooperation; Technology,,"Funding text 1: The EbA project entitled “Ecosystem‐based Adaptation through South‐South Cooperation,” also known as “EbA South,” was officially launched in 2013 and concluded in 2019.

In 2019, institutional investors worth US$14 trillion in assets called for the development of an independent classification system for quantifying the safety risks associated with tailings storage facilities (TSF), and played a central role in the Global Tailings Dam Portal Project disclosure request which called for a significant increase in transparency of TSF data. This paper draws upon an extensive literature review to explore the role and motivations of institutional mining investors in mitigating TSF failure risks. Results from qualitative interviews with institutional mining investors are presented to triangulate findings. It is concluded that the financial materiality of TSF failures cannot be argued to be the sole motivating factor for increased investor interest in this topic. Increasingly, the risk of TSF failure is being recognized as a critical environmental, social and governance (ESG) issue. Despite growing interest by investors to directly influence TSF management at mining sites, challenges arise due to the lack of a global tailings standard, technical training and differing regulations across jurisdictions. However, it is found that investors can also play an important role through pressuring company boards, and in improving the overall transparency of data associated with TSF risks. An outstanding research challenge lies in developing tools and frameworks to support investors to meaningfully incorporate TSF risks into investment decisions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disaster Management; Global Tailings Standard; Infrastructure Failure; Responsible Investment; Risk Management; Tailings Storage Facilities,,,"Allen, Rupert, Shareholder engagement in the extractive sector, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 2, 1, pp. 3-25, (2012); Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); Armstrong, Margaret, Accounting for tailings dam failures in the valuation of mining projects, Resources Policy, 63, (2019); Armstrong, Margaret, Why have so many tailings dams failed in recent years?, Resources Policy, 63, (2019); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2020); Chapter 16 Investor Mining and Tailings Safety Initiative, (2020); Uncertainty Upstream Potential Threats from Tailings Facility Failures in Northern British Columbia, (2015); Annual Report 2019, (2019); Bowker, Lindsay Newland, In the dark shadow of the supercycle tailings failure risk & public liability reach all time highs, Environments - MDPI, 4, 4, pp. 1-21, (2017)",,Elsevier Ltd,,22147918; 2214790X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095876520,

Additionally, civil engineers in their work must constantly make decisions, so their training is necessary. Therefore, the goal of this research is to present a methodology for teaching multi-criteria decision-making methods in the context of civil engineering and road infrastructure projects using sustainable factors. To achieve the objective of this study, a decision-making simulation activity has been designed based on a five-step research process: (1) definition and contextualization of the case study; (2) design and planning of the simulation activity; (3) implementation of this activity; (4) evaluation of indicators; and (5) statistical analysis of metrics. The teaching methodology used is of a practical-theoretical type and allows for the step-by-step teaching of three multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods that, according to the literature review, are widely used in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. This teaching activity is intended for undergraduate students and professionals in the AEC industry who require a decision-making tool that promotes transparency in problem-solving and who have no knowledge of MCDM. The results obtained in this research show that the method perceived by the group of students with the least difficulty was the weighting rating and calculating (WRC), because of its previous familiarity and use in academic environments. It is recommended that MCDM methods be taught in semester courses to students in training so that they can develop a deep understanding of these tools and can demonstrate their usefulness for decision making where there are many variables to consider, where there are many decision-makers, and for the incorporation of sustainable factors for project evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Civil Engineering; Decision Making; Mcdm; Road Projects; Sustainability; Factor Analysis; Multicriteria Analysis; Project Assessment; Research Work; Student; Sustainability; Teaching,factor analysis; multicriteria analysis; project assessment; research work; student; sustainability; teaching,"Funding text 1: Funding: The APC was funded by School of Civil Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile.; Funding text 2: The APC was funded by School of Civil Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat?lica de Valpara?so, Chile.

In particular, donor–recipient parity in decision making, civil society participation and private sector involvement are explored. The aim of this study is to lay the institutional groundwork for a larger study that will be analyzing the effect of these institutional innovations on the design and result of the fund’s projects. An exploratory qualitative case study approach is used that includes the review of the secondary literature, official sources from the GCF, participant observation and semi-structured interviews. This article concludes that the GCF indeed implemented important institutional innovations that are unique for a major international organization. At the same time, this article reveals that these innovations have created some important challenges for the functioning of the fund. For example, donor–recipient parity, in combination with consensus orientation, initially led to gridlock. It is also difficult for the GCF to balance the goal of transparency and civil society participation with the need for secrecy of private contracts and a speedy process demanded by the private sector. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Civil Society Participation; Climate Finance; Development Cooperation; Green Climate Fund; International Organizations; Multi-stakeholder Governance; Public–private Partnership; Adaptive Management; Civil Society; Developing World; International Organization; Private Sector; Questionnaire Survey; Social Participation,adaptive management; civil society; developing world; international organization; private sector; questionnaire survey; social participation,Funding: This research received funding from Ewha Womans University grants no. 1-2019-1542-001-2 and 1-2020-0815-001-1.,"Zhang, Fan, Can solar panels leapfrog power grids? the World Bank experience 1992-2009, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 38, pp. 811-820, (2014); Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, (2011); International Organization Polity Politics and Policies, (2006); Business and Development Studies Issues and Perspectives, (2020); Niederhafner, Stefan, Comparing functions of transnational city networks in Europe and Asia, Asia Europe Journal, 11, 4, pp. 377-396, (2013); Chandler, David, Constructing Global Civil Society: Morality and power in international relations, pp. 1-238, (2004); Rules for the World International Organizations in Global Politics, (2004); Why International Cooperation is Failing how the Clash of Capitalisms Undermines the Regulation of Finance, (2019); Haas, Ernst B., When knowledge is power: Three models of change in international organizations, pp. 1-281, (2024); A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change, (2009)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094146947,

Yet, the participation of local firms is still lacking, and little is known about the conditions potentially influencing firms’ adaptation decisions and mechanisms that might encourage private sector engagement. We address this gap with an empirical analysis of the willingness of manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate financially in collective flood adaptation in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), a hotspot of future climate change risk. Using scenario-based field experiments, we shed light on internal and external conditions that influence potential investments in collective initiatives and explain what role SMEs can play in flood adaptation. We find that direct impacts of floods, perceived self-responsibility, and strong local ties motivate firms to participate in collective adaptation, whereas government support, sufficient financial resources, and previously implemented flood protection strategies reduce the necessity to act collectively. Here, opportunity costs and the handling of other business risks play a decisive role in investment decisions. This study shows that although private sector engagement appears to be a promising approach, it is not a panacea. Collective initiatives on flood adaptation need formal guidance and should involve local business networks and partnerships to give voice to the needs and capacities of SMEs, but such initiatives should not overstretch firms’ responsibilities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Field Experiments; Flood Response; Private Sector Adaptation; Small- And Medium-sized Firms; Vietnam; Flood Control; Floods; Investments; Risk Assessment; Adaptation Decisions; Climate Change Adaptation; Collective Adaptation; Financial Resources; Government Supports; Investment Decisions; Small And Medium Sized Firms; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Climate Change; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Empirical Analysis; Flood; Manufacturing; Private Sector; Scenario Analysis; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam,Flood control; Floods; Investments; Risk assessment; Adaptation decisions; Climate change adaptation; Collective adaptation; Financial resources; Government supports; Investment decisions; Small and medium sized firms; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; empirical analysis; flood; manufacturing; private sector; scenario analysis; small and medium-sized enterprise; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam,"Funding text 1: We would like to thank our colleagues at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, University of Economics and Law in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for their valuable support in organizing and conducting interviews and field experiments.

While green building is a worthy endeavor, regardless of the banks' rationale for touting their involvement, it is nonetheless important to examine their motives. Are banks at the forefront of promoting green architecture and design, and if so, why? Clearly, these banks are in an influential position not only as the occupants of buildings themselves, but also as the financiers of buildings occupied by others. On the one hand, green buildings with LEED certification are believed to provide a variety of valuable benefits for their occupants, financial benefits for their owners, and environmental benefits for everyone. On the other hand, exclusive of these benefits, green buildings can enhance the public image of both their occupants and owners. Therefore, banks' promotion of green buildings via LEED might be primarily driven by the less lofty motive of greenwashing - using the appearance of environmental concern to counteract the bad publicity that has recently plagued both individual banks and the industry as a whole. Although intent is notoriously difficult to prove, quantitative and qualitative data support at least a strong presumption that the greenbacks earned by these green banks are not attributable to their working better but to their looking better. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Green Buildings; Greenwashing; Leed; Sustainable Construction; Architectural Design; Banking; Building; Environmental Issue; Image Analysis; Performance Assessment; Sustainability,architectural design; banking; building; environmental issue; image analysis; performance assessment; sustainability,,"Foundations of Leed; Federal Commitment to Green Building Experiences and Expectations, (2003); Leed by the Numbers 16 Years of Steady Growth, (2016); Memorandum of Understanding; Leed User Guide; Leed Certification Fails to Increase Energy Efficiency Says Environmental Policy Alliance, (2014); Newsham, Guy R., Do LEED-certified buildings save energy?

Investment in waste recycling, due to a high level of non-financial benefits, is considered sustainable, especially in the End-of-life Vehicles (ELV) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling areas. The research objective of this paper is to test the sensitivity of the model for sustainable management of recycling projects by applying a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to investment projects of car and refrigerator recycling in the Republic of Serbia. By testing the key risk factors of the above investment projects within the sensitivity analysis, the main aim is to determine the critical value of these variables in terms of the financial and social acceptability of these investment alternatives. The results obtained indicate that state subsidies have the greatest influence on defining the model of sustainable investment, especially in the field of e-waste recycling. The impact of other factors, the price of secondary raw materials and the social cost of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, is significantly smaller, but should certainly be taken into account when defining the optimal model of sustainable investment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cost-benefit Analysis; Elv; Recycling; Sustainable Investments; Weee; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Consumption Behavior; Cost-benefit Analysis; Electric Vehicle; Electronic Waste; Environmental Economics; Environmental Policy; Investment; Recycling; Sensitivity Analysis; Sustainability; Serbia,carbon dioxide; carbon emission; consumption behavior; cost-benefit analysis; electric vehicle; electronic waste; environmental economics; environmental policy; investment; recycling; sensitivity analysis; sustainability; Serbia,,"Mission in the Marketplace how Responsible Investing can Strengthen the Fiduciary Oversight of Foundation Endowments and Enhance Philanthropic Missions, (2007); Corporate Sustainability Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, (2017); Anbid Unep Fi Roundtable Private Banking and Sustainable Investment in Emerging Economies, (2017); Elkington, John, Towards the Sustainable Corporation: Win-Win-Win Business Strategies for Sustainable Development, California Management Review, 36, 2, pp. 90-100, (1994); Investing in Socially Responsible Mutual Funds, (2003); European Sri Study 2018; Report on US Sustainable Responsible and Impact Investing Trends, (2025); Palma-Ruiz, Jesús Manuel, Socially responsible investing as a competitive strategy for trading companies in times of upheaval amid covid-19: Evidence from spain, International Journal of Financial Studies, 8, 3, pp. 1-13, (2020); Waste and Recycling Middle East Wrme Special Supplement Auto Recycling 2014 2015; Simic, Vladimir M., End-of-life vehicle recycling - a review of the state-of-the-art, Tehnicki Vjesnik, 20, 2, pp. 371-380, (2013)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092907716,

Different views on sustainable investments were analyzed to identify different approaches to the main risks. A quantitative analysis was carried out to investigate the possible benefits and advantages of sustainable investment. Without taking into account the social perks of investing in sustainable funds, this study evaluates the performance and economic returns of both sustainable and traditional funds. The research was carried out in two parts by comparing samples of 30 sustainable and 30 traditional funds. Firstly, such methods as annual returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, skewness, and kurtosis were calculated and analyzed. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Fama–French three-factor model and Carhart four-factor model were used to value different market portfolios. The findings of this study suggest that sustainable funds are less risky than traditional funds. However, at the same time, we want to point to pay attention to the period of our analysis and to have in mind that an increasing demand of social responsible assets increases risks as well. However, no clear evidence was found to confirm that sustainable funds can generate higher returns compared to traditional piers or benchmark index. Moreover, after studying different methods the study reveals that the Fama–French three-factor model was the most suitable for explaining the traditional and sustainable funds’ results. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fama–french Three-factor Model; Returns; Sustainable Funds; Sustainable Investment; Traditional Funds; Corporate Social Responsibility; Investment; Performance Assessment; Quantitative Analysis; Risk Assessment; Skewness; Sustainability; Three-dimensional Modeling,corporate social responsibility; investment; performance assessment; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; skewness; sustainability; three-dimensional modeling,"Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71772013.","Aw, Edward N.W., A morality tale of ESG: Assessing socially responsible investing, Journal of Wealth Management, 19, 4, pp. 14-23, (2017); Statman, Meir, Classifying and measuring the performance of socially responsible mutual funds, Journal of Portfolio Management, 42, 2, pp. 140-151, (2016); Bauer, Rob M.M.J., International evidence on ethical mutual fund performance and investment style, Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, 7, pp. 1751-1767, (2005); Statman, Meir, ESG as waving banners and as pulling plows, Journal of Portfolio Management, 46, 3, pp. 16-25, (2020); Principles for Responsible Investment, (2017); Sandberg, Joakim, The heterogeneity of socially responsible investment, Journal of Business Ethics, 87, 4, pp. 519-533, (2009); He, Han, Risk factor identification of sustainable guarantee network based on logistic regression algorithm, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 13, (2019); An Investor Initiative in Partnership with Unep Finance Initiative and Un Global Compact What is Responsible Investment; Journal of Investing, (2016); Lewis, Alan, Morals, markets and sustainable investments: A qualitative study of 'champions, Journal of Business Ethics, 93, 3, pp. 483-494, (2010)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092905962,

Valuing virtuous behaviour through the transfer and sharing of risks among several actors allows us to achieve benefits for all. The COVID-19 pandemic leads us to experiment with new forms of public health protection, including through insurance instruments. The role of insurance companies, intrinsically linked with the protection of primary areas such as healthcare and welfare, therefore becomes more critical than ever in terms of securing the protection of people, families, and productive activities.

However, a consistent, robust and comparable standard for the estimation of the environmental impacts of green bonds is lacking, hampering growth in sustainable finance. As encouraged by second-party opinion reports, the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) allows for the complete environmental evaluation of projects over their life cycle. Here we estimate the LCA-based impacts along several environmental metrics of a set of green bonds for renewable power plants issued by the European Investment Bank from 2015-2018. Life cycle avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions varied by a factor of 12 from 29 to 359 t CO<inf>2</inf> eq./M€ invested-information that is not available to investors at the outset, indicating that funds are unlikely to be allocated efficiently. Furthermore, linking environmental impact indicators to the Sustainable Development Goals unveils significant trade-offs. Bonds may perform well on water use and emissions, while having a negative impact on waste and land use. Conducting LCA of green bonds comes at a cost of additional methodological challenges and increased data needs compared with current reporting practices. However, the ready infrastructure of LCA databases and methodologies can provide the necessary tools to meet future reporting requirements as the EU taxonomy framework and standardization of impact reporting evolve. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Green Bonds; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Finance; Climate Change; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Energy Policy; Environmental Protection; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Investments; Land Use; Life Cycle; Sustainable Development; Climate Change Mitigation; Environmental Evaluation; European Investment Bank; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Renewable Energy Projects; Renewable Power; Trade Off; Water Use; Environmental Impact; Alternative Energy; Climate Change; Environmental Protection; Green Economy; Life Cycle Analysis; Project Assessment; Sustainability; Trade-off,Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Land use; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Environmental evaluation; European Investment Bank; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energy projects; Renewable Power; Trade off; Water use; Environmental impact; alternative energy; climate change; environmental protection; green economy; life cycle analysis; project assessment; sustainability; trade-off,,"Sustainable Finance Progress Report Inquiry Design of A Sustainable Financial System, (2019); Investing in Climate Investing in Growth, (2017); Bloomberg, (2019); Schumacher, Kim D.G., Sustainable finance in Japan, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 10, 2, pp. 213-246, (2020); Zhang, Hao, Regulating green bond in China: definition divergence and implications for policy making, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 10, 2, pp. 141-156, (2020); Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019, (2019); Tolliver, Clarence H., Drivers of green bond market growth: The importance of Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and implications for sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, 244, (2020); Journal of Sustainable Finance Investment, (2020); 2019 Green Bond Market Summary, (2019); Credit Trends Global Financing Conditions Bond Issuance is Expected to Grow 3 8 in 2020, (2020)",,IOP Publishing Ltd custserv@iop.org,,17489326,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092427754,

This study addresses this issue by investigating whether and how the implementation of various government initiatives concerning environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues affect the institutional ownership of casino firms in Macao, the world's gaming capital. Employing structural equation modeling, this study further examines whether and how RI makes financial sense in this special industry. The results show that the implementation of all four ESG-improving government initiatives (including an anticorruption campaign, visa restriction, smoking bans, and responsible gambling) leads to a significant increase in the institutional ownership of casino firms in general, demonstrating the presence and mechanism of RI in the “sin” industries. Such RI is then found to be conducive to a lower equity risk of casino firms in general. The results also illustrate that these intuitional investors are not one homogeneous group. The norm-constrained institutions are the prominent responsible investors and can help strengthen the equity risk management of casino companies whereas the natural arbitrageurs do not undertake any significant role in this regard. The results are robust across various estimation techniques, model specifications and alternative measures of firm risk. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Equity Risk; Gaming; Institutional Ownership; Mediating Effect; Responsible Investing,,We would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their very insightful comments and constructive suggestions on the previous version of the paper.

We study whether the SRI (Social Responsible Investing) concerns are affecting traditional management. In an initial sample of 22 SRI and 221 conventional UK domestic equity pension funds from 2016 to 2018, we apply the nearest-neighbour matching to account for fund-characteristic differences, selecting 20 matched conventional funds. We then analyse the influence of fund characteristics on ESG fund scores, and the ESG-score impact on performance and flows with linear models. Our results show that the ESG scores of conventional and SRI funds are influenced by some common characteristics (age/turnover and expenses negatively/positively influence ESG scores), which are consistent with SRI features. Additionally, a higher ESG screening intensity provides greater return and larger flows.

While most of these narratives are in direct reference to economic indicators and existing potentials for Africa's sustainable development, there is no doubt that the rapidly urbanizing landscapes of Africa, characterized by sprawling cities, high-rise buildings, and flashy city lights represent an urban revolution in most of Africa's cities. Beneath the glow of flashy city lights lies a dark and gloomy contrast: Inner city slums, sanitation dilemmas and environmental public health challenges which converge to pose significant challenges to Africa's broader sustainable development aspirations. This paper foregrounds urban sanitation challenges and public health imperatives from a contemporary urban planning perspective. The paper argues that urban planning and public health have shared a close historical relationship both in thinking and practice; however, recent developments in urbanization processes have seen the two professions drift apart. The paper further asserts that human habitat considerations from the perspective of urban planning in Ghana, in particular, treat issues of sanitation management and public health and safety issues as after-thoughts and are excluded in initial planning processes. While the paper acknowledges the influence of increased population growth and the reality of climate change in current urbanization processes, the paper advocates for new approaches that make cities and other urbanizing communities resilient. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Public Health; Sanitation Governance; Sustainable Development; Urban Planning; Urbanization,,,"African Review of Economics and Finance, (2012); Aliyu, Alhaji Abubakar, Urbanization, cities, and health: The challenges to Nigeria - A review, Annals of African Medicine, 16, 4, pp. 149-158, (2017); Amoateng, Paul, Managing physical development in peri-urban areas of Kumasi, Ghana: A case of Abuakwa, Journal of Urban and Environmental Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 96-109, (2013); Arthurson, Kathy D., Urban Planning and Health: Revitalising the Alliance, Urban Policy and Research, 34, 1, pp. 4-16, (2016); Barros, Carlos Pestana, Urban dynamics in Maputo, Mozambique, Cities, 36, pp. 74-82, (2014); Boamah, Nicholas Addai, Land use controls and residential land values in the Offinso South municipality, Ghana, Land Use Policy, 33, pp. 111-117, (2013); Boamah, Nicholas Addai, Challenges to the enforcement of development controls in the Wa municipality, Habitat International, 36, 1, pp. 136-142, (2012); Bodini, Antonio, Cities as ecosystems: Growth, development and implications for sustainability, Ecological Modelling, 245, pp. 185-198, (2012); Brooks, Andrew, Was Africa rising?

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews with twenty-four stakeholders from a diverse cross-section of the Australian property industry were undertaken in 2018 and 2019. Findings: A range of barriers to action on climate change were identified. These barriers centre around (1) information: lack of clear, reliable, and trusted sources of climate change information; (2) cost: competing economic demands, and the perceived threat that investing in climate change action poses to competitiveness; and (3) regulation: the inaction of governments thus failing to provide a regulatory environment to address climate change. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative research provides perspectives from actors in different sectors of the Australian property industry. While it provides an in-depth understanding of the barriers to addressing climate change adaptation, it is not necessarily a nationally representative sample. Practical implications: The study identifies barriers to climate change adaptation, and establishes practical ways in which the Australian property industry can address these barriers and the role that government regulation could have in generating industry-wide change. Social implications: Climate change poses significant challenges to society. Built environments are significant contributors to climate change, and thus the property industry is well-placed to make positive contributions to this global challenge. Originality/value: Limited research has examined barriers to climate change action in the property industry. This research provides novel insights from the perspective of key actors across a diverse range of property industry sectors. This new knowledge fills an important gap in understanding how to address climate change in Australia and broader contexts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Barriers; Climate Change; Property Stakeholders; Real Estate; Regulation,,"We acknowledge the research assistance by Laura Curtoni with data analysis and Jenny Pitts identifying potential interviewees.

Findings: There are several major challenges that both reporting corporations and investors need to address in realizing the potential of TCFD style risks, opportunities and dependencies reporting. Key among these is developing new practices of climate-related scenario analysis and reporting. Practical implications: There is potential for many different academic research studies to provide solid evidence in helping improve the practical impact of TCFD style sustainability reporting.

This analytical essay discusses the theoretical foundations of Islamic finance, and the difference of opinions and issues like the current focus on quantity versus quality and authenticity versus innovations. It suggests a reforms agenda with the objective to make Islamic finance a sustainable discipline distinct from the conventional finance. It also suggests a different role for the regulators, the practitioners and the jurists, and the code of ethics for the management of Islamic banking and finance institutions (IBFIs). While the conventional institutions are moving towards value based financial intermediation (VBI), it is more a duty of the IBFIs to move to VBI by focusing on financing the real production and business sectors for shared development in the societies. The reforms agenda also assigns a responsible role to the jurists, the practitioners, the regulators, and the governments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Aaoifi; Form Vs.

In this way, research papers derived from Scopus as well as institutional reports such as main documents, sustainability reports, and product portfolios publicly available on webpages from public, private, and development banks are used to create a database of SFP where their main characteristics are included and classified. Based on the research trends identified, the results show the development of financial products focused on environmental, social, and government (ESG) matters, mainly from the credit side, of more sustainable financial markets and products under fintech ecosystems. The results show that because of regulatory and government support through mechanisms such as green protocols and social and environmental responsibility policies, private financial institutions of Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina have led the development of both social and green financial products. These study's findings may be used for several policymakers to broaden the opportunities available in sustainable financing and thus, provide a roadmap that researchers and practicing professionals can use to improve their understanding of SFP. Finally, the study presents the potential for further research in the field, both with a qualitative and a quantitative approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esg; Latin America; Sdgs; Sustainable Banking; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Finance; Sustainable Financial Products; Banking; Financial Market; Government; Policy Making; Regulatory Framework; Sustainability; Argentina; Brazil; Colombia; Latin America; Scopus,banking; financial market; government; policy making; regulatory framework; sustainability; Argentina; Brazil; Colombia; Latin America; Scopus,,"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Adoption of the Paris Agreement, (2015); Steffen, Will L., Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 115, 33, pp. 8252-8259, (2018); undefined, (2012); Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2019 Illuminating Inequalities, (2020); Falcone, Pasquale Marcello, Greening of the financial system and fuelling a sustainability transition: A discursive approach to assess landscape pressures on the Italian financial system, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 127, pp. 23-37, (2018); Harvard Deusto Business Review, (2011); Masud, Md Abdul Kaium, Is green regulation effective or a failure: Comparative analysis between Bangladesh Bank (BB) green guidelines and global reporting initiative guidelines, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 4, (2018); Zhang, Dayong, A bibliometric analysis on green finance: Current status, development, and future directions, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 425-430, (2019); González-Ruíz, Juan David, Investment valuation model for sustainable infrastructure systems: Mezzanine debt for water projects, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 26, 5, pp. 850-884, (2019); Miroshnychenko, Ivan, Green practices and financial performance: A global outlook, Journal of Cleaner Production, 147, pp. 340-351, (2017)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088824360,

Due to its raison d'etre, reporting remained finance-centered, to protect financial capital providers. From the 1970's, the question of the interests of 'stakeholders' emerged, with attempts of 'social reporting', 'corporate social responsibility', 'environmental', and 'social and environmental' and finally 'integrated' accounting and reporting. These trends are reflected also in the European Union legal framework, both in regulation of especially financial intermediaries and the 'non-financial' reporting. This article is based on an extensive literature review, research conducted in the Sustainable Market Actors for Responsible Trade (SMART) project, and socio-legal and economic empirical research based conceptual analysis of the impact of these reporting systems and their relationship to financial accounting and reporting. The result of the research is that sustainability is reduced to focus on institutional investors and other members in the investment supply chain, and climate change issues only, and new regulatory solutions are required. Based on the most recent developments in EU law and in European jurisdictions, possible paths forward are envisaged to encourage sustainability in reporting and assurance, and through that, in governance.

Kratie province, in particular, has suffered from climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, storms, lightning, and heatwaves. To date, climate change interventions in the province have primarily focused on impacts on agriculture. However, enhancing the climate resilience of micro businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector is also crucial since the provincial economy increasingly depends on the interlinkage between agriculture, tourism and related enterprises. This article examines how climate change has impacted micro businesses in Kratie Town, and how they responded to the impacts. This study is based on semi-structured interviews with micro entrepreneurs randomly selected in the town. Results show that businesses have been predominantly affected by floods and storms. Business exposures and locations, types of business, production and supply chains, and client bases determined different impacts of and responses to these climate-related hazards. Businesses adopted primarily temporary and reactive responses rather than long-term systematic measures. Strengthening adaptive infrastructure, both physical and informational, will improve businesses’ capability to prepare for and cope with these disasters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Cambodia; Climate Change; Disaster Resilience; Impact; Micro Business; Business; Climate Change; Disaster Management; Hospitality Industry; Microenterprise; Natural Disaster; Questionnaire Survey; Tourism; Agriculture; Article; Cambodia; Climate Resilience; Controlled Study; Disaster; Economic Aspect; Flooding; Human; Randomized Controlled Trial; Semi Structured Interview; City; Kracheh; Cities; Climate Change; Disasters; Floods,business; climate change; disaster management; hospitality industry; microenterprise; natural disaster; questionnaire survey; tourism; agriculture; article; Cambodia; climate resilience; controlled study; disaster; economic aspect; flooding; human; randomized controlled trial; semi structured interview; city; Kracheh; Cities; Climate Change; Disasters; Floods,"Funding text 1: This research was part of a project on “Climate Change Adaptation in Post-Disaster Recovery Processes: Flood-Affected Communities in Cambodia and Fiji” (CAF2017-RR01-CMY-Neef) funded by the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN).

In the Cadbury Report and in other mainstream corporate governance codes, 'system' refers only to the 'financial aspects of corporate governance', that is, shareholder value and emphasis on the board's and the management's accountability to providers of financial capital only. During the last few years however, sustainability has been included through 'integrated reporting' in corporate governance codes especially in Africa (South Africa) and Asia (Malaysia, Philippines). For example, the South African King reports on corporate governance connect the use of integrated reporting to report on an organisation's corporate governance practices and economic-social-environmental triple-bottom-line performance. The leading normative framework for integrated reporting, the International Integrated Reporting Council's International <IR> Framework, is based on an idea of 'shared value creation' by providers of the 'six capitals' (financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, societal and environmental capitals). As such integrated reporting represents a stakeholder management model already integrated - at least on the text level - in many corporate governance codes, just enlarging the concept of capital providers from shareholders only to other internal stakeholders, and the goal of capital efficiency and profit maximisation from financial capital only to other five forms of internal capital provisions. It is also a new step in the development of social and environmental accounting and reporting, rooting from the 1970s and sustainability reporting from the 1990s. The concept of a 'business model' represents the way how an organisation creates value, comprising all its activities, its relationships with stakeholders and its tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, and finally the boards responsibilities, as for the board, 'corporate governance' and sustaining and developing the company's business model are essentially the same thing. In the end of the day, it is a question what kind of 'business model' integrated reporting based corporate governance really reflects, and how it possible varies from shareholder-centred business model. The purpose of this paper is to test (1) what kind of stakeholder model, if any, integrated reporting and especially International <IR> Framework represents, (2) what is the impact, if any, of integrated reporting to material corporate governance in the codes it is included in, and (3) if yes, does an integrated view and especially the 'integrated thinking' behind International <IR> Framework represent a genuine sustainable value creation driven business model based on the boundaries of the planet and social foundation for the humanity, or is it only a view to encourage organisations to take care of the profits of the specific capital providers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Governance; Integrated Reporting; Integrated Thinking,,This research is part of Sustainable Market Actors for Responsible Trade (SMART) project.

It explores how responsible investment emerges as an avenue for political action in the context of disintermediated governance. Analyzing one strategy of responsible investment, the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks into investment decision making, through the frame of the social derivative, the article argues that a derivative logic of ethics underpins ESG risk management. This complicates contemporary understandings of precarity as risk-shifting, because ESG integration creates connections between unlikely parties, opening up new forms and directions for political contest through finance. However, the article reveals that the contingent and profit-driven ethics on which ESG risk management is based establishes a narrow foundation on which these contests take place. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Derivative; Finance; Financialization; Precarity; Responsible Investment; Risk,,"Funding text 1: This research is part of the author’s doctoral research is supported by an Australian Post-Graduate Award scholarship and by a University of Sydney Arts Doctoral Travel Grant.; Funding text 2: The author is deeply grateful to Gareth Bryant and Dick Bryan for their support and guidance in drafting this paper.

The paper defines big data and illustrates how an inductive, big data approach can help improve decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: The paper demonstrates how big data can support inductive reasoning that can lead to enhanced real estate decisions. To help readers understand the dynamics and drivers of the big data regime shift, an extensive list of hyperlinks is included. Findings: The paper concludes that it is possible to blend traditional and non-traditional data into a unified data environment to support enhanced decision-making. Through the application of design thinking, the paper illustrates how socially responsible development can be targeted to under-served urban areas and helps serve residents and the communities in which they live. Research limitations/implications: The paper demonstrates how big data can be harnessed to support decision-making using a hypothetical project. The paper does not present advanced analytics but focuses aggregating disparate longitudinal data that could support such analysis in future research. Practical implications: The paper focuses on the US market, but the methodology can be extended to other markets where big data is increasingly available. Social implications: The paper illustrates how big data analytics can be used to help serve the needs of marginalized residents and tenants, as well as blighted areas.

However, existing analyses of win-win strategies tend to take a systems perspective, while paying less attention to the specific actors and activities, or their interconnections, which are implicated in win-win strategies. Moreover, they hardly address adaptation WWS. To address these gaps and support the identification and enhancement of WWS for entrepreneurs and policy-makers, we propose a typology of WWS based on the concept of a value-consumption chain, which typically connects several producers with at least one consumer of a good or service. A consideration of these connections allows an evaluation of economic effects in a meso-economic perspective. We distinguish 34 different types of WWS of companies, households and the state, for which 23 real-world examples are identified. Further, contrary to prevailing views on the lack of a business case for adaptation, we do identify real-world adaptation WWS, though they remain underrepresented compared with mitigation WWS. Our typology can be used as an entry point for transdisciplinary research integrating assessment of individual transformative socioeconomic activities and highly aggregated approaches assessing, e.g. the macro-economic effects of WWS. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Green Business Models; Green Entrepreneurs; Mitigation; Typology; Win-win; Climate Change; Economics; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy; Climate Change Mitigation; Economic Perspective; Industrial Ecology; Scientific Community; Sustainability Science; Sustainability Transition; Win-win Strategies; Economic And Social Effects; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Connectivity; Economic Cycle; Industrial Development; Interdisciplinary Approach; Policy Making; Socioeconomic Status; Sustainability; Typology,Climate change; Economics; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Climate change mitigation; Economic perspective; Industrial ecology; Scientific community; Sustainability science; Sustainability transition; Win-win strategies; Economic and social effects; adaptive management; climate change; connectivity; economic cycle; industrial development; interdisciplinary approach; policy making; socioeconomic status; sustainability; typology,"Funding text 1: We want to thank our colleagues from the GREEN-WIN consortium for very productive discussions of our findings.

Ecological footprint in Nigeria is classified into carbon footprint, non-carbon footprint, and total ecological footprint. The results show that in Nigeria, a positive shock in financial development (an increase in financial development) has significant reducing effect on ecological footprint (i.e., improves environmental sustainability) while a negative shock in financial development (a decline in financial development) has significant increasing effect on ecological footprint (i.e., deteriorates environmental sustainability). Asymmetry test shows that a significant difference exists in how negative and positive shocks in financial development impact on carbon footprint and total ecological footprint, but not for non-carbon footprint. On the basis of the total ecological footprint, the adjustment asymmetry from the dynamic multiplier graph shows that the response of ecological footprint to a negative shock in financial development is stronger. Further findings from the analysis show that economic growth, energy consumption, urbanization, and economic globalization are all drivers of environmental sustainability in Nigeria. Overall, the results highlight the need for a deepened financial system, as part of the strategies for achieving sustainable development in Nigeria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Asymmetry; Carbon Footprint; Ecological Footprint; Environmental Sustainability; Financial Development; Nigeria; Nonlinear Ardl; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Asymmetry; Carbon Emission; Ecological Footprint; Economic Development; Environmental Impact; Globalization; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Nigeria; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Urbanization; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Economic Development; Urbanization,asymmetry; carbon emission; ecological footprint; economic development; environmental impact; globalization; sustainability; sustainable development; Nigeria; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; urbanization; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Economic Development; Urbanization,,"Abokyi, Eric, Industrial growth and emissions of CO2 in Ghana: The role of financial development and fossil fuel consumption, Energy Reports, 5, pp. 1339-1353, (2019); Adejumo, Oluwabunmi Opeyemi, Openness and Greenness: Pay-Offs or Trade-Offs for the Nigerian Economy, World Sustainability Series, pp. 863-886, (2020); Adejumo, Akintoye Victor, Foreign Direct Investment, Domestic Investment and Green Growth in Nigeria: Any Spillovers?, World Sustainability Series, pp. 839-861, (2020); Agbanike, Tobechi Faith, Oil price, energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions: insight into sustainability challenges in Venezuela, Latin American Economic Review, 28, 1, (2019); Ahmad, Manzoor, Does financial development asymmetrically affect CO2 emissions in China?

This approach involves estimating the economic value of virtual water flows. A realistic tea supply chain case study is presented to test this new approach and compare it with alternative volumetric and stress-weighted methods. The case study is used to highlight the total value of the blue and grey water used to produce 1 tonne of tea as a finished good ($224). The case study also illustrates how variations in the relative unit value of water between geographies, in this case between multiple locations where crops are cultivated (India $0.08 m3, Indonesia $0.09 m3 and Kenya $0.27 m3), can be used to inform supply chain optimisation and allocative efficiency. Indeed, the case study suggests that taking into account the economic value of virtual water may provide differing prescriptions for the sustainable management of supply chains when compared to the traditional volumetric water footprint, and the stress-weighted water footprint used in LCA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Benefit Transfer; Economic Value Of Water; Stress-weighted Water Footprint; Supply Chain Management; Virtual Water; Water Footprint; Agricultural Land; Comparative Study; Crop Plant; Economic Conditions; Supply Chain Management; Tea; Water Footprint; Water Use Efficiency; India; Indonesia; Kenya,agricultural land; comparative study; crop plant; economic conditions; supply chain management; tea; water footprint; water use efficiency; India; Indonesia; Kenya,"This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council , UK [grant number ES/J500215/1 ] and The University of Sheffield .","Charting Our Water Future Economic Frameworks to Inform Decision Making, (2009); Acquaye, Adolf A., Measuring the environmental sustainability performance of global supply chains: A multi-regional input-output analysis for carbon, sulphur oxide and water footprints, Journal of Environmental Management, 187, pp. 571-585, (2017); undefined, (2019); Martínez Aldaya, Maite, The water needed for Italians to eat pasta and pizza, Agricultural Systems, 103, 6, pp. 351-360, (2010); Martínez Aldaya, Maite, Strategic importance of green water in international crop trade, Ecological Economics, 69, 4, pp. 887-894, (2010); Water Policy Allocation and Management in Practice, (1996); Allan, John Anthony Tony, Virtual water: A strategic resource global solutions to regional deficits, Ground Water, 36, 4, pp. 545-546, (1998); Allan, Tony J.A., Productive efficiency and allocative efficiency: Why better water management may not solve the problem, Agricultural Water Management, 40, 1, pp. 71-75, (1999); Arnell, Nigel W., Climate change and global water resources: SRES emissions and socio-economic scenarios, Global Environmental Change, 14, 1, pp. 31-52, (2004); Bayart, Jean Baptiste, A framework for assessing off-stream freshwater use in LCA, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 15, 5, pp. 439-453, (2010)",,Elsevier B.V.,,09218009,,ECECE,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082407293,

Urban climate adaptation measures are beneficial over the longer term, particularly in coastal areas, yet the upfront costs of such measures are significant. Moreover, public actors responsible for adaptation to flood risk face constrained budgets. A promising strategy for overcoming these constraints and enabling greater adaptation investment is land reclamation that includes adaptation, i.e. flood risk reduction. Land reclamation in high-value urban areas can generate substantial revenues through the sale or lease of new land, or taxes on increased economic activities, thus offsetting public adaptation investments. This paper explores the potential of land reclamation for leveraging public adaptation investments and associated distributional issues, by analysing 3 urban land reclamation and adaptation projects in Germany, the Netherlands and the Maldives. We find that all projects have leveraging potential, and leveraging in projects primarily aimed at land creation is particularly high. Further, due to low adaptation costs needed to protect revenue streams in such projects, these investments appear to be ‘low-regret’. Regarding distributional aspects, high project costs and limited public budgets for adaptation constrain public actors’ ability to ensure equitable outcomes through planning instruments, for example, social housing. Further, in implementation, competition for project benefits can lead to further inequalities. We conclude that urban land reclamation presents a significant opportunity to leverage public adaptation investments under certain conditions. We further outline future research needs including to extend land-based financing theory from related urban infrastructure sectors to inform the design of equitable governance arrangements and to better understand the role of such urban land reclamation projects in regional or national development pathways. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Budget Control; Climate Change; Costs; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Floods; Investments; Land Use; Reclamation; Urban Planning; Economic Activities; Flood Risk Reduction; National Development; Reclamation Project; Revenue Streams; Social Housing; Socio-economic Development; Urban Infrastructure; Land Reclamation; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Economic Activity; Finance; Flood; Governance Approach; Infrastructure Planning; Investment; Land Reclamation; Socioeconomic Conditions; Urban Area; Urban Economy; Maldives; Netherlands,Budget control; Climate change; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Floods; Investments; Land use; Reclamation; Urban planning; Economic activities; Flood risk reduction; National development; Reclamation project; Revenue streams; Social housing; Socio-economic development; Urban infrastructure; Land reclamation; adaptive management; climate change; economic activity; finance; flood; governance approach; infrastructure planning; investment; land reclamation; socioeconomic conditions; urban area; urban economy; Maldives; Netherlands,,"Adger, W.

The adsorbent was used for adsorption removal of Congo red dye from synthetic wastewater in a batch process, the effects of operating parameters such as; initial concentrations (10–50 ppm), contact time (0–240 min) and pH were investigated. Data from the kinetic study were analyzed with pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order, while the mechanism was analyzed using Elovich and intra-particle diffusion models. The equilibrium data were evaluated using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm models. The adsorption kinetics of the dye removal followed pseudo-first-order with constant rate increases from 0.031 to 0.068 min–1 as the initial concentration increases from 50 to 200 mg L–1. Equilibrium data fitted well with all the isotherm data were investigated, the Langmuir model showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of the adsorbent were 199.0 mg g–1. The negative ΔG° values obtained from thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption spontaneous, while positive ΔH° value of 6.549 kJ mol–1 and entropy change ΔS° revealed an increased activity at the solid/liquid inter-face.

The automobile sector, the highest emitter of CO<inf>2</inf> into the atmosphere, is under pressure to reduce the emissions it creates in the various stages of its products’ life cycle. This study attempted to analyze and quantify the use of water and energy in five automobile manufacturing industries namely BMW, Daimler, FCA, Nissan and Volkswagen. Additionally, the study also explored the potential for reducing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in these industries by bringing down its water and energy consumption. On an average, 4.94 m3 of water and 2.74 MW h of energy are used directly to produce a car. Among the companies analyzed, BMW is highly water efficient and generates more revenue out of one unit of energy consumed. Other companies are also achieving their own efficiency targets by employing several resource efficient technologies. The analysis shows that both water and energy use must be reduced to have a substantial reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emission. BMW needs to reduce its water use by 38% and energy consumption by 31% to have a 15% reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> emission. Nissan has the highest potential to reduce CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by reducing its water use and energy consumption. Minimizing the use of resources, coupled with switching to renewable resources, could bring about emission reductions in the industry to a larger extent. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Automobile; Emission Reduction Potential; Energy Efficiency; Energy Intensity; Water Efficiency; Water Intensity; Automobile Manufacture; Automobiles; Carbon Dioxide; Emission Control; Energy Utilization; Life Cycle; Water Resources; Automobile Manufacturing; Comparative Studies; Emission Reduction Potentials; Energy Intensity; Renewable Resource; Substantial Reduction; Water And Energies; Water Efficiency; Energy Efficiency,Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Water resources; Automobile manufacturing; Comparative studies; Emission reduction potentials; Energy intensity; Renewable resource; Substantial reduction; Water and energies; Water efficiency; Energy efficiency,"Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the Thai Pipe Industry Co.

Common ownership has long been the topic of scholarly debate with many scholars traditionally arguing that common ownership presents antitrust problems. Rather than enter into the antitrust debate, this Article argues that common ownership presents great virtue for corporate governance, and more specifically-corporate compliance. In recent years the Department of Justice and other enforcement authorities have increasingly directed their resources towards enforcing laws that are typically oriented towards specific industries, such as healthcare (pharmaceuticals), financial and energy industries, or geographic areas. These laws-including the Foreign Corruption Practices Act, False Claims Act, Bank Secrecy Act, as well as laws and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering, environmental, and antitrust violations-expose companies associated with specific industries to heavy legal risks-which I term ""macro legal risks."" This Article argues that institutional investors who hold shares in corporations in line with the common ownership structure are uniquely positioned to enhance the compliance of those corporations with industry-oriented laws, and to minimize exposure to macro legal risks. Institutional investors who invest in corporations that operate in the same industry can take advantage of three interrelated merits of common ownership: (1) enhanced incentives for monitoring compliance of corporations with industry-oriented laws, which accordingly leads to minimizing macro legal risks; (2) privileged access to rulemaking and lawmaking; and (3) experimental learning of macro legal risks. These merits allow institutional investors to better monitor corporations in which they invest and practice effective corporate governance and compliance. The incentives of institutional investors increase due to increased aggregate exposure to problems affecting a certain industry. The difficulty of responding to these problems decreases as institutional investors are able to apply a one-size-fits-all approach to these problems, rather than develop individualized solutions for specific corporations. Due to their status as major asset holders, institutional investors develop close relationships with regulators and lawmakers, giving them a chance to influence regulation beyond the normal notice and comment process and anticipate trends in law and regulation. Finally, as a result of their wide holdings, institutional investors can apply knowledge gained in investigations and enforcement proceedings against a corporation to prevent these from happening to other corporations within the industry. This Article is the first to analyze the benefits of common ownership in the area of corporate compliance. It argues that in an era of increasing enforcement based on industry-oriented characteristics, institutional investors who invest in line with a common ownership structure will become more active in overseeing corporate compliance and more effective in minimizing corporate wrongdoing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Harvard Law Review, (2016); Ultimate Ownership and Bank Competition, (2016); Azar, José A., Anticompetitive Effects of Common Ownership, Journal of Finance, 73, 4, pp. 1513-1565, (2018); Rise of Common Ownership, (2018); undefined; Fin Times, (2017); Antitrust Law Journal, (2017); undefined; N Y Times, (2016); Antitrust Law Journal, (2025)",,University of Iowa p-q@uiowa.edu,,00210552,,,,English,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088565579,

Any prospect of achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 presupposes mobilizing the estimated US$23.3 trillion currently locked-up in risk-averse private savings to bridge the gap between developing countries' demand for capital and the current global financial architecture's capacity to supply it. The three biggest obstacles to sustainable banking identified by the authors are discussed: (1) The uncertain bankability of projects; (2) non-transparency in tracking sustainable capital flows; and (3) no universal mechanism capable of making matches between green investment supply and demand and what MDBs have actually done to overcome these roadblocks, and might do in future, is also discussed. Seen through the lens of ""applied constructivism"", MDBs are revealed to be norm entrepreneurs proactive since at least the 1970s in socially constructing most of the basic norms and practices of sustainable banking which the private sector relies on or is now striving to take up. MDBs are typically the first ""port of call"" for international governmental organizations (IGOs) and civil society organizations wishing to establish a sustainable financial framework for development; and are the likeliest political agents to pioneer sustainable banking in future. MDBs would do well to develop an awareness of the methods of Constructivism, which they have actually been unwittingly using, to empower themselves to meet the challenges of the 21st century. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Commercial Banks; Constructivism; International Development; Multilateral Development Banks (mdbs); Norm Entrepreneurs; Sustainable Banking; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Banking; Capital Flow; Civil Society; Entrepreneur; Investment; Private Sector; Sustainability; United Nations Development Program,banking; capital flow; civil society; entrepreneur; investment; private sector; sustainability; United Nations Development Program,,"Proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, (2019); United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, (2014); From Billions to Trillions Transforming Development Finance Post 2015 Financing for Development Multilateral Development Finance, (2015); Blended Finance in the Poorest Countries the Need for A Better Approach, (2019); World Bank Gross Domestic Savings Current US World 2018, (2019); Report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing, (2014); Mawdsley, Emma, ‘From billions to trillions’: Financing the SDGs in a world ‘beyond aid’, Dialogues in Human Geography, 8, 2, pp. 191-195, (2018); Alden, Chris, The Western Way of Development: A Critical Review, Governing China in the 21st Century, pp. 19-38, (2020); Jing, Yijia, New Development Assistance in the Making: An Introduction, Governing China in the 21st Century, pp. 1-18, (2020); Farias, Carine, Organizational entrepreneurship, politics and the political, Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 31, 7-8, pp. 555-566, (2019)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081203356,

The moment is favorable to gather these contributions to consistently advance the state-of-the-art in CS and, also, discuss them in application to real contexts. The main objective of the paper is to systematize, through a literature review using content analysis of the 30 most cited articles from 2007 to 2017, the guiding pillars of CS management. A systematic search for papers was carried out in Scopus and Web of Science, and the initial screening of the papers was assisted by the coding software, MAXQDA 2018, through which the authors structured and analyzed their main insights, contributions, and conclusions. After getting acquainted with the sample, an in-depth reading of the texts was conducted and 60 CS elements were identified. The elements cited in the relevant literature were grouped into six pillars related to corporate sustainability strategy, corporate governance, human resources management, knowledge and innovation management, measurement, disclosure, and independent assurance, and management systems, and integrated management systems. The main contribution of this paper is to identify the management pillars of CS in a systematic way to consistently advance the state-of-the-art in the subject. Also, this study provides understanding to managers on the main aspects that make up the integration of this construct in the companies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business Sustainability; Content Analysis; Corporate Sustainability; Literature Review; Sustainable Management; Business Development; Corporate Strategy; Governance Approach; Literature Review; Management Practice; Resource Management; Sustainability; Scopus,business development; corporate strategy; governance approach; literature review; management practice; resource management; sustainability; Scopus,"Funding: This research was funded by the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), grant number PQ 312894/2017, and the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), grant numbers 2016/20160-0, 2017/18304-7 and 2019/08750-5.","Bocken, Nancy M.P., A literature and practice review to develop sustainable business model archetypes, Journal of Cleaner Production, 65, pp. 42-56, (2014); Adams, Richard J., Sustainability-oriented Innovation: A Systematic Review, International Journal of Management Reviews, 18, 2, pp. 180-205, (2016); Joyce, Alexandre, The triple layered business model canvas: A tool to design more sustainable business models, Journal of Cleaner Production, 135, pp. 1474-1486, (2016); Baumgartner, Rupert J., Corporate sustainability strategies: Sustainability profiles and maturity levels, Sustainable Development, 18, 2, pp. 76-89, (2010); Milne, Markus J., W(h)ither Ecology?

The coal demand of the main consumer, China, has peaked in 2013 and is slowly declining. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, has excluded coal-related companies for ethical reasons. Important players like the UN or the EU have already begun to describe pathways towards decarbonization. Increasing competition between coal mining companies and the mining regions can be expected worldwide if companies want to keep their positions on the global and national coal markets. Companies will focus on the best deposits. European countries like France, Spain, or Germany are only forerunners of this development—their centuries of coal production have been finished. The concept of sustainable development (SD) is fundamentally based on a model of progress where ecological, economic, and social dimensions should be developed equally and positively. But without the idea of competition, the concept of SD is incomplete. Questions arise, such as how can SD be realized on stagnating or declining markets without guarantees for companies “to live forever”? How can SD be a corporate goal in a phase of decline? How can declining mining regions sustainably progress into a better future? The German hard coal mining industry’s lifecycle has ended in 2018 after 60 years of stagnation and decline. As of 2019, all hard coal consumed in Germany will be imported, especially from Colombia, Russia, and South Africa. What has been done in Germany to handle the coal decline in a sustainable way and the lessons learned from this process is described in this paper. It may be useful for mining regions who will face a similar future sooner or later. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coal; Mining Regions; Sustainable Development; Transition; Anthracite; Coal; Coal Mines; Commerce; Life Cycle; Planning; Sustainable Development; Coal Mining Industry; Coal Production; European Countries; Hard Coal Mining; Product Life Cycles; Social Dimensions; Sovereign Wealth Funds; Transition; Coal Industry,Anthracite; Coal; Coal mines; Commerce; Life cycle; Planning; Sustainable development; Coal mining industry; Coal production; European Countries; Hard coal mining; Product life cycles; Social dimensions; Sovereign wealth funds; Transition; Coal industry,,"Iddri and Climate Strategies, (2017); Fuhrung Von Bergbauunternehmen, (2000); Gas 2018 Analysis and Forecasts to 2023, (2018); undefined, (2018); New York Times, (2017); Un Climate Change News 2018, (2018); How China is Leading the Renewable Energy Revolution, (2017); undefined, (2018); an Historical Case Study for the Project Coal Transitions Research and Dialogue on the Future of Coal, (2017); Unep Finance Initiative Portfolio Investment in A Carbon Constrained World the Third Annual Progess Report of the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition, (2017)",,Springer,,25243462; 25243470,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075132251,

For countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) wishing to achieve economic growth and meet the sustainable development goals, deployment of modern energy projects offers potential opportunities. SSA is currently experiencing strong economic growth and showing positive trends in human development indicators. With annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates reaching 5% since 2000, more than twice that of the 1980s and 1990s, Africa has become a fast growing continent. Access to morden and sustainable energy will be critical to sustain the growth. About 47% of the population of SSA live on less than US$ 1.25 per day and 27% are hungry or undernourished. A large number of these people depend on agriculture for livelihood. They depend on access to land and traditional forms of bioenergy. Food security and economic development in SSA can be addressed more effectively with morden energy than without it. It is a truism that there is rampant energy poverty in rural areas in SSA. Energy presents both opportunities and risks for sustainable development. Energy is linked to a range of developmental issues such as poverty alleviation and modernization of rural economies. Many developmental activities in SSA such as agriculture, transport, water, education, income generation and health have energy requirements. Taken severally, energy and development represent key issues in SSA today. Holistically, energy and development form an important nexus in SSA.

Transactions carried out also no longer refer to ordinary things. The modern era of society indeed prefers a more efficient payment process, namely through a credit card. On the other hand, the advancement of digital technology also provides opportunities for perpetrators of crime in cyberspace. The fraud, which was initially carried out with the objects of written reports, began to move lanes towards data manipulation in the form of carding. Purpose/Objective Study: This paper is intended to analyze and examine carding as cyber fraud in three legal studies: criminal law, business, and commercial law, and transnational criminal law. This study illuminates the intersection between criminal law, business and commercial law, law and technology, and international criminal law in carding cases. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper is normative legal research using a comparative approach and regulations related to carding and cyber fraud. Findings: The study highlighted that carding as a manifestation of cyber fraud is also a transnational crime, which involves networks or groups across national borders to carry out certain illegal businesses or activities. Included in this case is the data theft on credit cards. Of course, this has resulted in a shift of public trust towards the credit card provider sector, namely banks, so that there is a need to strengthen the juridical pathway nationally and internationally. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carding; Cyber Crime; Cyber Fraud; Transnational Crime,,,"International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Science, (2015); Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Globalization of Law and Local Wisdom Icglow 2019, (2019); International Journal of Finance and Banking Research, (2020); Journal of Forensic and Investigative Accounting, (2018); Fraud Examination, (2025); Kader Bangsa Law Review, (2019); Eai Endorsed Transactions on Security and Safety, (2016); Shs Web of Conferences, (2020); Andryanto, Chandra, Law Enforcement Against Fraud and/or Embezzlement (Study of KSP Intidana Central Java, Indonesia), Journal of Indonesian Legal Studies, 3, 1, pp. 47-74, (2018); Kapita Selekta Hukum Pidana, (2003)",,Universitas Ahmad Dahlan,,14126834; 25500090,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166003804,

This essay provides a comprehensive analysis of the different types of costs that can arise from climate change litigation. Financial institutions provide an ideal focal point for this analysis because their role as enablers of some of the activities that contribute to aggravate the climate emergency make their exposure to the risk of climate change litigation unique and complex: they can be directly exposed to the risk of litigation as potential defendants in a case, facing potential pay-outs and fines, legal and administrative costs, insurance costs, financing costs, and reputational costs; but they can also be exposed indirectly, through litigation that targets their counterparties, especially their clients, which can lead to losses if the client’s solvency is affected, and can impose additional reputational costs.

Contemporary development discourse puts the onus on every governmental and non-governmental organisation to contribute towards sustainable development. Banks play a critical role in the achievement of sustainable development goals due to its intermediary role in the economy. Recently, various international guidelines and roadmap were developed to promote the notion of sustainable development such as Equator principles, PRI, UNEP FI, and Global reporting initiatives (GRI). The purpose of this paper was to discuss the evolution of the notion of sustainable development vis-à-vis the role of banking institutions in sustainable development and also examined contemporary national and international initiatives that propagate the role of banks towards sustainable development and finally suggested a framework to achieve sustainable development through sustainable banking practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking; Csr; Environment Protection; Green Banking; Social Development; Sustainable Banking; Sustainable Development,,,"Asa University Review, (2013); Business and Management Studies, (2015); European Scientific Journal, (2016); Social Banking and Social Finance, (2011); Greener Journal of Business and Management Studies, (2013); Bihari, Suresh Chandra, CSR and performance: The story of banks in India, Journal of Transnational Management, 16, 1, pp. 20-35, (2011); Business Spectrum, (2011); Understanding Sustainable Development, (2008); Sustainable Banking the Greening of Finance, (2001); Our Common Future, (1987)",,The Society of Economics and Development,,23220430; 22775412,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109878007,

This discharge is a little specific kind because one electrode is covered by a dielectric material, thereby preventing the discharge to move towards electrical breakdown. One of its most important applications is the production of ozone (o3) for air treatment specially dedicated to the food industry to extend storage life of food products. The aim of this paper is to study and identify the set point of electrical parameters of DBD discharge for ozone generation using the Response Surface Modeling (RSM) method; the optimal values obtained are then applied in a system of conservation of food products. The experiments were carried out on a laboratory experimental bench. Obtained results pointed out that the investigated parameters of DBD have significant effect not only on ozone production, but also for prolonging shelf life of food products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Food Shelflife; Optimization; Ozone,,,"Alva R, Elvia, Non-thermal plasma for exhaust gases treatment, Frontiers of Mechanical Engineering, 10, 3, pp. 301-305, (2015); Amini, Malihe, Application of response surface methodology for simultaneous carbon and nitrogen (SND) removal from dairy wastewater in batch systems, International Journal of Environmental Studies, 69, 6, pp. 962-986, (2012); Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, (1998); Babak, Natalia A., Transport Construction Negative Impact on the Environment, Procedia Engineering, 189, pp. 867-873, (2017); Bellebna, Yassine, Experimental design for enhancement of betanin in beet juice using pulsed electric field, Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Brasov, Series II: Forestry, Wood Industry, Agricultural Food Engineering, 9, 2, pp. 71-80, (2016); Plasma Sources Science and Technology, (2018); Cook, Bruce, Conversion of methane to aromatics over Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst in different reactor types, Applied Catalysis A: General, 365, 1, pp. 34-41, (2009); Dlugolecki, Andrew F., Climate Change and the Financial Services Sector: An Appreciation of the UNEPFI Study, Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, 28, 3, pp. 382-393, (2003); Journal of Transformative Entrepreneurship, (2013); Fuglestvedt, Jan S., Climate forcing from the transport sectors, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105, 2, pp. 454-458, (2008)",,Transilvania University of Brasov 1,,20652135,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100615097,

There are many warning signs that this traditional model is no longer working, including growing income inequality, increasing risks and costs of climate change, and an emerging backlash against technology and globalization-all of which are now beginning to threaten the viability of the current model of corporate capitalism. While there have been many efforts to adopt more enlightened approaches and mitigate such externalities, limited overall progress has been made on key issues like plastics pollution, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and income inequality. Such issues are challenging because of delays between action and impact, a disjunction between private costs and collective benefits, intergenerational and intragenerational distribution issues, and the scale of coordination required to mitigate. Several perspectives from systems science and biology can help shape a new paradigm, including recent thinking on: nested complex adaptive systems, system robustness and longevity, system leverage points, and the effectiveness of bottom-up solutions. Leveraging these, we propose some principles for a new paradigm for corporate strategy, including: setting enterprise strategy in a broader system context, a greater emphasis on resilience, building corporate statesmanship, and developing a new approach to sustainable business model innovation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"S Ray Explore the Sustainability of the Worlds Biggest Companies, (2019); Business Model Innovation Concepts Analysis and Cases, (2019); Adaptive Strategy, (2019); Total Societal Impact A New Lens for Strategy, (2017); What Companies can Learn from World Leaders in Societal Impact, (2019); Bloomberg News, (2019); Insideclimate News, (2019); A Revolution Rising from Low Chatter to Loud Roar, (2018); Consequences of Economic Inequality, (2015); Corporate Compliance Insights, (2019)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781000097931; 9780367367336,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096261653,

Such potential, in term of economic and social value that SSF can deliver, is reflected in the increasing of interest within the public policy-making arena in the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). More in detail, it is also underlined by the raising of public and private investment into promoting and supporting them. Within such evolving arena, the exact scale and scope of SSF’s contribution to the improvement of SDGs worldwide is difficult to delineate and measure accurately, but there seems to be universal agreement that SDGs represent an ideal and widespread area where SSF can register a significant growth. However, limited research addressed the marriage of these two fields. The purpose of this research are: i) to shed light on existing academic literature embracing both Social and Sustainable Finance and SDGs issues, ii) explore emerging trends deriving from international policy-making actors, market builders, managers, senior academics and, iii) to identify the main areas for further research focusing on SSF and SDGs. In order to derive a research agenda about such emerging research topic, the study adopts a triangulated approach based on qualitative mixed methods. With such objectives in mind, the study provides an extensive literature review in order to depict a comprehensive overview of existing knowledge considering both SSF and SDGs topics. The analysis is therefore enhanced by the trends identified from literature deriving from public policy- making actors and market-builders as well as from invited commentaries on SSF from senior scholars and managers. Thus, a holistic perspective on SSF experience, useful to identify the main areas for further research on SSF in the sustainability industry, was derived. The study, therefore, aims to provides, through a triangulated analysis of the concepts, frameworks and trends, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms for managing the interplay between SSF and SDGs, by highlight future avenues of research in this field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Research Agenda; Sdgs; Social Finance; Sustainable Finance,,,"undefined, (2019); Abdullah, Mohammad Azmi, Waqf, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and maqasid al-shariah, International Journal of Social Economics, 45, 1, pp. 158-172, (2018); On the Sustainable Development Goals and the Role of Islamic Finance, (2015); Alshaleel, Mohammed Khair, Islamic finance, sustainable development and developing countries: Linkages and potential, pp. 281-305, (2019); Alt, Rainer, FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 28, 3, pp. 235-243, (2018); Al Shajarah Journal of the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization Istac, (2019); Balkenhol, Bernd, Microfinance: Research, debates, policy, pp. 1-148, (2018); Halal Cryptocurrency Management, (2019); undefined, (2019); Betti, Gianni, The relationship between investor materiality and the sustainable development goals: A methodological framework, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 7, (2018)",,ACRN Oxford Ltd. office_uk@acrn.eu,,23057394,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093652297,

In Romania, SMEs represent 99.7% of all organizations and employ approximately 66% of all nationally registered employees, percentages approximately equal to those recorded in the European Union. However, the productivity of Romanian SMEs is quite low, feeling very strong any influence from the external environment. Risk management is increasingly considered a tool that can contribute to the sustainable development of SMEs. The implementation of a risk management system is a complex process, influenced by many factors. In this context, the objective of the present article is to analyze the determinants of behavior towards the implementation of risk management in Romanian SMEs. The data for the analysis were obtained through a questionnaire addressed to SMEs and processed by a fuzzy model. The results revealed two essential ideas: (1) the determinants of SMEs behavior towards risk management implementation are: stakeholders' requirements, training in risk management, the existence of a leader for the implementation and attitude towards risk; (2) attitude toward risk is influenced by the business lifespan and awareness of the importance of risk management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attitude Towards Risk; Behavior; Fuzzy Approach; Integrated Risk Management; Small And Medium-sized Enterprises; Sustainable Development,,This study is conducted within the Management Ph.D. School of the Bucharest University of Economic Studies.,"International Review, (2016); Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Construction and Real Estates Management Iccrem 2010 Leading Sustainable Development Through Construction and Real Estates Management 1st 3rd December 2010 Brisbane Isbn 978 7 112 12612 5, (2010); Beasley, Mark S., Enterprise risk management: An empirical analysis of factors associated with the extent of implementation, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 24, 6, pp. 521-531, (2005); Management Dynamics in the Knowledge Economy, (2015); Journal of International Technology and Information Management, (2018); Best Romanian Management Studies 2013 2014, (2015); Colesca, Sofia Elena, Analysis of passenger’s satisfaction with the quality of the public transportation mode choices in bucharest: A fuzzy approach, Economic Computation and Economic Cybernetics Studies and Research, 51, 4, pp. 109-125, (2017); Enterprise Risk Management Integrated Framework, (2004); Acrn Journal of Finance and Risk Perspectives, (2014); Best Practice in Risk Management, (2007)",,"Editura ASE Bucuresti editura@ase.ro Sos.

Consequently, starting from the often observed oversimplified distinction of voluntary vs. mandatory offsets, the aim of this study was to develop a refined typology with regard to the voluntariness of biodiversity offsets. To this end, an expert- and internet-based research approach was applied. This included establishing an online personal learning network, most notably via the Biodiversity Offsets Blog. Building on the method of empirically grounded typification after Kluge (1999) and Lazarsfeld (1937), criteria for voluntariness have been derived from theoretical concepts, e.g. altruism, voluntary environmental approaches, and corporate responsibility. Together with evidence from a worldwide desk-based screening of 90 biodiversity offsets cases, this was integrated into a typology of the following seven types of biodiversity offsets: 1. Regulatory biodiversity offsets: Required by law and enforced. 2. Conditional biodiversity offsets: Required by financial institutions (e.g. International Finance Corporation). 3. Enabled biodiversity offsets: Fostered by governments and NGOs through pilot schemes, guidance, etc. 4. Sectoral biodiversity offsets: Take part in a voluntary self-commitment of a sector (e.g. mining). 5. Corporate biodiversity offsets: Resulting from a voluntary self-commitment of a corporation. 6. Local biodiversity offsets: Single offsets, which are most likely developed at the local level in a consensual process. 7. Altruistic biodiversity offsets: Truly voluntary offsets that are driven by the altruistic motivation to make a positive impact. The analysis and comparison of these types has shown the variety and complexity of biodiversity offsets and that huge differences exist on a global scale. Moreover, it is concluded that biodiversity offsets are highly context dependent and Ix no “one-size-fits-all” solution to offsets exists—neither regulatory nor voluntary. The analysis of the state of the scientific knowledge and the practical evidence explored throughout this study encourage the critical analysis and exploration of the various forms of (voluntary) biodiversity offsets, in particular with regard to the evaluation of their outcome in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. This can help to contribute to an informed debate about biodiversity offsets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Environmental Responsibility; Empirically Grounded Typification; Eu No Net Loss Initiative; Impact Mitigation; The Business Case For Biodiversity Offsets; Voluntary Biodiversity Offsets; Voluntary Environmental Approaches,,,"Empirisch Begrundete Typenbildung, (1999); Zeitschrift Fur Sozialforschung, (1937); Igoe, Jim, Neoliberal conservation: A brief introduction, Conservation and Society, 5, 4, pp. 432-449, (2007); Igoe, Jim, A spectacular eco-tour around the historic bloc: Theorising the convergence of biodiversity conservation and capitalist expansion, Antipode, 42, 3, pp. 486-512, (2010); Biodiversity Offsets Technical Study Paper, (2014); Kiesécker, Joseph M., Offsets: Factor failure into protected areas, Nature, 525, 7567, (2015); Eingriffsregelung Umweltvertraglichkeitsprufung Ffh Vertraglichkeitsprufung, (2004); Restaurer La Nature Pour Attenuer Les Impacts Du Developpement Analyse Des Mesures Compensatoires Pour La Biodiversite, (2015); Toolkit for Performing Resource Equivalency Analysis to Assess and Scale Environmental Damage in the European Union, (2008); undefined",,Springer International Publishing,,,9783030255930; 9783030255947,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089319111,

Scientific research points out that it is predominately driven by human activity. There are three different types of risks that arise from this change. These have been broadly grouped into physical, transition and liability risks. These risks can impact general insurers to different degrees, depending on their business areas and investment strategies. These may pose different strategic, investment, market, operational and reputational risks.

Russia, which ranks fourth in the world in terms of primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, is adhering to a strategy of “business as usual” and continues to rely on fossil fuels. Energy export is critical for the state budget, for the key energy companies and for many regions in the country which strongly rely on hydrocarbon revenues. But the changing global environment and decarbonization agenda pose an existential threat for all the key Russian stakeholders, challenging the very sustainability of the economic (and political) system in the country. Despite the fact that in September 2019 Russia joined the Paris Agreement, domestically decarbonization of the energy sector is not yet on the agenda: a sceptical attitude to the problem of global climate change prevails among stakeholders. GDP energy intensity remains high, constrained by relatively low energy prices and high capital costs. The share of solar and wind energy in the Russian energy balance is insignificant and, according to official forecasts, it is not expected to exceed 1% by 2035. The challenge for Russia in the coming years is to develop a new strategy for energy sector development (at least for energy exports), even in the absence of a significant domestic climate change agenda, in the face of increasing global competition, growing technological isolation and financial constraints. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Budget Control; Carbon Dioxide; Decarbonization; Energy Utilization; Fossil Fuels; Global Warming; Sustainable Development; Wind Power; Carbon Dioxide Emissions; Financial Constraints; Geopolitical Implications; Global Climate Changes; Global Competition; Global Environment; Primary Energy Consumption; Solar And Wind Energies; Costs,Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Sustainable development; Wind power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Financial constraints; Geopolitical implications; Global climate changes; Global competition; Global environment; Primary energy consumption; Solar and wind energies; Costs,,"Contribution of the Gas Industry to the Formation of an Energy Model Based on Hydrogen Vesti Gas Sciencescientific and Technical Collection Environmental Protection Energy Saving and Labor Protection in the Oil and Gas Complex, (2017); Bank Moves Out of Coal A Guide to the Latest New Banking Sector Commitments on Reducing Coal Financing, (2019); Ecological Bulletin of Russia, (2018); Center of Energy Efficiency Cenef, (2013); New Energy Outlook, (2017); 30 Th Power Generation Order Survey, (2006); Global and Russian Energy Outlook Up to 2040, (2016); Global and Russian Energy Outlook 2019, (2019); Presidential Decree of May 13 2017 no 208 on the Strategy of Economic Security of the Russian Federation for the Period Until 2030, (2017); Electricity Information, (2018)",,Springer,,21951284; 21951292,9783319008219; 9783642258862; 9781447146667; 9781447143840; 9783319269481; 9781447147268; 9781447149101; 9781447149675; 9781447147862; 9781447151395,,,English,Book chapter,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086760855,

It describes different forms of SRI in the financial markets, and deliberates on the rationale for the utilization of positive and negative screenings of listed businesses and public organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review suggests that the providers of financial capital are increasingly allocating funds toward positive impact and sustainable investments. Therefore, this descriptive paper provides a factual summary of the proliferation of SRI products in financial markets. Afterwards, it presents the opportunities and challenges facing the stakeholders of SRI. Findings: This research presents a historic overview on the growth of SRI products in the financial services industry. It clarifies that the market for responsible investing has recently led to an increase in a number of stakeholders, including contractors, non-governmental organizations and research firms who are involved in the scrutinization of the businesses’ environmental, social and governance (ESG) behaviors. Originality/value: This discursive contribution raises awareness on the screenings of positive impact and sustainable investments. The researcher contends that today’s socially responsible investors are increasingly analyzing the businesses’ non-financial performance, including their ESG credentials.

Corporate disclosures relating to sustainability has increased intensely to respond to the increased demand for sustainability data from stakeholders. Corporate characteristics may influence the degree of disclosure of sustainability information. Using 285 observations from Malaysian public-listed companies, from 2014 to 2018, the study examines the influence of specific corporate characteristics on the disclosure of sustainability practices. The study applies two-stage least square regression analysis to validate the hypotheses and models. Earnings per shares, return on equity, company size and market capitalization are used as the proxies for corporate characteristics and the Combined Economic, Social and Governance (ESG) Score as the proxy for sustainability practices disclosure measure. The results show that the return on equity and market capitalisation are significantly related to the level of disclosure of sustainability practices. Thus, return on equity and market capitalisation have an impact on the company's level of disclosure of sustainability practices. The implication to practice is that a well-performing corporate with large market capitalisation may actively adopt sustainability practices as a strategy rather than merely comply with regulatory requirements. Profitable companies with large market capitalisation should invest substantially in implementing sustainable practices to achieve lower operating costs and higher yield in the long-term.

Under moments of disruption, reliable and equitable access to adequate provision of public goods is anticipated to be increasingly challenging in cities across the world due to observed and anticipated disruptions of climate change and variability on city-wide infrastructures. Many cities facing such conditions are seeing rapid population and infrastructure growth enhancing exposure and vulnerability. One such example of disruptive climate risk is enhanced water scarcity. Private responses to the Cape Town drought adopted off-grid water technologies in order to secure their own supply while curtailing their dependence on the public water system. Unintended consequences of the nascent off-grid capacity created by private actors precipitated system transformations and accommodation challenges to disrupted public systems. The novel capacity generated through these responses to urban risk demonstrate what is identified here to be ‘partial functional redundancy’ – a key expression of resilience.

Java Island is still categorised as one of the biggest foreign capital investment destinations compared to other destinations. Meanwhile, the tertiary sector (i.e., sectors of electricity, gas and water; construction; commerce and reparations; hotels and restaurants; transport, warehousing and telecommunications; housing, industrial areas and office space; and other services) are recorded as much more superior to the primary and secondary sectors. However, there have been significant worries about the emerging foreign capital investment that will subsequently contribute to the downfall of the sectors of micro, small and medium enterprises (Usaha Mikro Kecil dan Menengah or UMKM) in Indonesia. In contrast, the change of Investment Negative List (Daftar Negatif Investasi or DNI) does not affect the development of UMKM because the rate of competitiveness between domestic and foreign investment is basically different. The efforts to balance between PMA and the development of UMKM should be based on the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Some related principles, such as society, environment, and government should be a concern for the foreign investors in PMA. This article tries to analyse the regulations either in the region or nationally, in order to foster an easy climate of business (ease of doing business) and to protect UMKM by accommodating PRI in regulation formations especially for PMA. The first issue focused on the national regulation formations, while the second issue stressed the local regulation analysis, especially in Java island, which has more foreign investment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Foreign Capital Investment; Government; National And Local Regulation; Responsible Investment,,,"In Proseding Seminar Nasional Competitive Advantage, (2011); Ang, Chai Tew, Challenges and possible drivers of LCA implementation in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia: A review, Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 22, 2, pp. 335-347, (2014); Ekonomi Dan Keuangan, (2013); Jurnal Dinamika Hukum, (2013); Jurnal Ekonomikawan, (2015); Handriana, Tanti, The role of relationship marketing in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Jurnal Pengurusan, 48, pp. 137-148, (2016); American Business Review, (1999); Bin Khidmat, Waqas, The value relevance of R&D and free cash flow in an efficient investment setup: Evidence from Chinese A-listed firms, Asian Journal of Accounting Research, 4, 1, pp. 95-111, (2019); Jurnal Fakultas Hukum Uii, (2014); Millati, Izzato, Analysis unit role of micro and medium enterprises (SMES) as support in the village of village tourism, Tamansari, Banyuwangi, Advanced Science Letters, 23, 9, pp. 8085-8089, (2017)",,Primrose Hall Publishing Group,,22011323; 22011315,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079827845,

For bank clients, adverse project effects on cultural heritage can result in reputation risk, impede access to finance and insurance, increase operational costs, and jeopardize on-Time and on-budget delivery of projects. To address this risk, financial institutions implement environmental and social policy frameworks that include specific requirements for the consideration of cultural heritage. This article examines the place of cultural heritage in the lending practices of 25 of the world's largest private-sector banks and its relevance for heritage practitioners who may be retained to provide advice, review or undertake fieldwork, and prepare studies in keeping with the private-sector bank policies and external standards described. The article concludes with a recommended best practice for private-sector financial institutions, a call to action for heritage practitioners to advocate for robust safeguards, and a call for support of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals by both heritage practitioners and private-sector financial institutions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banks; Cultural Heritage; Due Diligence; Environmental Assessment; Equator Principles; Financial Institutions; Iso 26000; Risk; Safeguards; Sustainable Development Goals,,,"Electronic Document, (2019); Electronic Document, (2019); Electronic Document, (2019); Electronic Document Https Www Anz Com Content Dam Anzcom Shareholder Au22289 Anz Sustainability Review 2018 Fa Online Pdf, (2019); Electronic Document, (2019); Electronic Document, (2019); Electronic Document, (2019); New York Times, (2012); Electronic Document, (2019); Electronic Document, (2019)",,Cambridge University Press journals_subscriptions@cup.cam.ac.uk,,23263768,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078913206,

Climate services can provide improved indicators and metrics to help investors better manage physical climate risks. This chapter presents the results of the ERA4CS-JPI Climate project ClimINVEST aimed to co-design tailored information on climate change. It provides an overview of investors’ needs and information gaps on the physical impact of climate change. It identifies what information sources financial actors rely on and what challenges they face in decision-making incorporating available climate change information while taking into account diverse investor mandates and risk management approaches. Three unique geographical cases are presented, both on commonalities and differences, namely France, the Netherlands and Norway. In France, the 2015 Energy Transition for Green Growth Act (Article 173-VI) requires institutional investors to report on their integration of climate-related risks in their investment policies. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Central Bank and financial institutions are challenged to deal with potential flood risks from more frequent precipitation and sea level rise. In Norway, actors such as Finance Norway and the Norwegian government are assessing the risks from physical impacts of climate change on the Norwegian economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Services; Financial Sector; France; Investor Needs; Norway; Physical Climate Risks; The Netherlands,,"Funding text 1: The ClimINVEST project is part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate, and funded by RCN (NO), ANR (FR), NWO (NL) with co-funding by the European Union (Grant 690462).

Many governments across the world signed up for these goals. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon noted at the outset that business would be a vital partner in achieving the SDGs. This easy-to-digest book provides a critical evaluation of how a range of multinational companies from across different commercial sectors are currently addressing the SDGs and the challenges they are facing in contributing to them. The private sector has thus been set the challenge of responding positively in support of the SDGs whilst at the same time acting in the shorter-term interests of its stakeholders. Using a wealth of illustrative materials drawn from company reports and other sources, this book looks at the response of 80 companies and organisations from eight different industry sectors. It examines the different approaches taken, discusses how far the SDGs are actively supported and reviews how progress is being assessed against related targets and objectives. In addition to an analysis of each industry sector, the book provides a summary overview of all industry sectors studied, identifying the most and least supported SDGs overall. This book will be of interest to the fast-growing body of academics studying and researching sustainability, as well as to industry managers and public-sector operators involved in sustainability management and reporting. It provides detailed commentary and insights and identifies both key themes from the research and critical issues for the successful implementation of the SDGs in the period up to 2030. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Environment an Interdisciplinary Anthology, (2008); Amsler, Sarah S., Embracing the politics of ambiguity: Towards a normative theory of quot;sustainability, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 20, 2, pp. 111-125, (2009); Barr, Stewart W., Environment and society: Sustainability, policy and the citizen, pp. 1-297, (2008); Stakeholder Theory Pictures the Environment and Sustainable Development do We have Enough Pictures in Our Heads or do We Need Something Different, (2011); Castro, Carlos J., Sustainable development: Mainstream and critical perspectives, Organization and Environment, 17, 2, pp. 195-225, (2004); How Deloitte Supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, (2015); Sustainability the Corporate Challenge of the 21st Century, (2000); Environmental Sciences, (2006); 2010 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sdgs, (2017); Fehling, Maya, Limitations of the Millennium Development Goals: A literature review, Global Public Health, 8, 10, pp. 1109-1122, (2013)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781000760163; 9780367237196,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105223538,

Financial innovation is one way through which resources can be secured, while also providing business opportunities for market actors. The insurance sector, in particular, has been at the forefront of such innovation, developing financial instruments to manage the flooding, fire, and storm risks that characterize an increasingly unstable world. We examine one such financial instrument—the catastrophe bond—which transfers extreme risk from insurers and reinsurers to capital markets. Using a comprehensive database of all catastrophe bonds issued through March 2016, we find that the modeling which underlies catastrophe bonds is not demonstrably better than guesswork at predicting the financial consequences of extreme events. Moreover, secondary data reveal that market actors are under no illusions about the level of precision and accuracy provided by the models. Our analysis suggests that catastrophe bonds do not lend themselves to analysis through con-ventional sociological theories of financial markets. Drawing on theories of ignorance, we reflect on the social arrangements that sustain financial markets in contexts of extreme uncertainty. We conclude with some cautionary notes for harnessing financial tools in support of the SDGs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Abatzoglou, John T., Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113, 42, pp. 11770-11775, (2016); Priceless on Knowing the Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing, (2004); undefined, (2017); Alfieri, Lorenzo, Global projections of river flood risk in a warmer world, Earth's Future, 5, 2, pp. 171-182, (2017); Cat Bond Ils Issuance Passes 5 7bn in 2018 Market Hits 33bn in Size, (2018); Cat Bond Loss Expectations Rise on Going Creep, (2019); Catastrophe Bonds Ils Issued and Outstanding by Year; Q1 2019 Catastrophe Bonds Ils Market Report; Financial Risks of Climate Change, (2009); How to do Things with Words, (1962)",,Academy of Management,,21681007,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093658576,

More specifically, it examines the impact of green credit on the profitability of commercial banks and the differences between China and other countries while using the generalized method of moments. The research shows that the Equatorial Principles project-financing ratio of international banks positively affects bank profitability, while the ratio of green credit for Chinese commercial banks is inversely related to their profitability. Further, a comparative study of China and other countries highlights that the green credit business is at significantly different stages in China and the rest of the world. This study also finds that the profitability of China’s banking sector is positively affected by asset size, management expense ratio, cash ratio, and GDP growth rate, in addition to the common influencing factor of non-performing loan ratio, whereas asset size and capital adequacy ratio negatively affects the international banking sector.

Even though Green Building Index Interior Tools (GBI-IT) has been developed and implemented but there is lack of post-occupancy evaluation being conducted in assessing the sustainability level of the certified project, particularly on the Space Energy Intensity (SEI). Thus, embarking on the research problem whether the certified interior space sustainable level is according to the pre-occupancy scoring benchmark as vision by the designers upon occupancy, particularly on Energy Efficiency (EE). The research objective is to examine the SEI, to identify similarities and discrepancies of SEI upon pre-occupancy evaluation and post occupancy evaluation and to assess the key EE sub-criteria that affect Space Energy Intensity (SEI) and to improve continuing sustainable EE upon post occupancy. The Space Energy Intensity equation approach and implementation method is used in this research in order to measure total space energy consumption per year/interior space area. The research design will be formulated into three key stages, which are; 1. Content analysis of GBI Interior Tools EE core criteria; 2. Comparative data analysis between pre-occupancy and post-occupancy EE sub-criteria scoring and; 3. Assessment of key EE sub-criteria that affect Space Energy Intensity (SEI) and to improve continuing sustainable EE upon post occupancy. The findings for research problem based on Space Energy Intensity (SEI) on-site measure from case study will improve sustainability practice and continuing sustainable agenda particularly on EE.

Consequently, a new financial paradigm is going to be needed, which will require the strengthening of investor care and protection, so contributing to the restoration of trust in the financial sector. In particular, on 18 December 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) launched two public consultations on draft technical advice for the integration of sustainability risks and factors into the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) regimes, with the aim to clarify the so-called fiduciary duties and to increase transparency in the financial services industry. However, the success of the EU initiatives on investor protection regulation may be seriously endangered by the existence of many challenges, weaknesses, and contradictions raised by economists and stakeholders in relation to the definition of sustainability, ESG data availability and reliability, the development of an EU taxonomy, conflicts of interest, product governance, and suitability assessment. This paper starts by briefly analyzing the recent developments of the regulation of sustainable finance at the global level, then offers a more detailed view on the establishment of a common regime on sustainable finance in the EU, with particular reference to the action plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth'. Then, it examines the recent proposals for regulation on sustainable finance, specifically considering the barriers to the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the EU investor protection regulation-with particular reference to investment services-with respect to its four main dimensions: (1) disclosure of product information, (2) conduct of business (COB) rules, (3) product governance and intervention, and (4) financial education. The paper concludes that the EU reforming proposals, though admirable, risk oversimplifying a complex issue that cannot be easily solved without considering its practical implications on each category of financial operators in the performance of different financial services. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Esginvesting; Eulaw; Investorprotectionregulation; Non-financial Reporting; Sustainable Finance; Action Plan; European Commission; European Union; Finance; Financial Services; Governance Approach; Maximum Sustainable Yield; Stakeholder; Sustainability,action plan; European Commission; European Union; finance; financial services; governance approach; maximum sustainable yield; stakeholder; sustainability,,"Our Common Future, (1987); United Nations Millennium Declaration, (2000); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; Paris Agreement on Climate Change; Addisababaactionagenda of Thethirdinternationalconference Onfinancingfordevelopment; Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 2030, (2015); Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, (2017); Public Consultation Draft Issues Paper on Climate Change Risks to the Insurance Sector; Principles for Responsible Banking, (2019); Commission Communication A Sustainable Europe for A Better World A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075874072,

Besides the operational activities of this enormous sector, its investing and lending choices have considerable influence on sustainability. The carbon footprint measurement indicators have to be standardized in order to estimate the contributions of the banks in the global climate change precisely.

To this end, the major capital flows associated with its investment and underwriting businesses would need to be redirected towards carbon-neutral activities. Since insurance companies can be viewed as large portfolios consisting of financial risks (asset side) and underwriting risks (liability side), we suggest an asset pricing approach to detect carbon-intensive positions on their balance sheets.

The ideology of markets as the most efficient form of organising economic activity has led to the expansion of their usage, both in terms of what is governed by the market, but also in terms of the spaces in which the practices of a given market apply. However, there have been important challenges to market expansion, particularly on political and ethical grounds. This paper analyses how the socio-technical practices of market expansion can be affected by political contestation and individual moral judgements. This is analysed in the context of two markets for biodiversity offsets, in the United States and England. In both cases, regulators attempted to devise and standardise calculative mechanisms and socio-technical practices that promoted the use and expansion of the market. However, these socio-technical market practices have struggled to cross and negotiate uneven political and social spaces, being subject to moral judgements and political contestation. The paper demonstrates how the socio-technical practices of market expansion are affected by social entanglements, highlighting how this creates limits to the expansion of the market as a form of governance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biodiversity Offsets; Governance; Market Expansion; Moral Economy; Technological Zones; Economic Activity; Governance Approach; Ideology; Market Development; Neoliberalism; Political Economy; Technological Development; England; United Kingdom; United States,economic activity; governance approach; ideology; market development; neoliberalism; political economy; technological development; England; United Kingdom; United States,,"Value in Ethics and Economics, (1993); Oryx, (2015); Apostolopoulou, Elia, Neoliberal capitalism and conservation in the post-crisis era: The dialectics of ""Green"" and ""Un-green"" Grabbing in Greece and the UK, Antipode, 47, 1, pp. 15-35, (2015); Barry, Andrew, Technological zones, European Journal of Social Theory, 9, 2, pp. 239-253, (2006); Barry, Andrew, Introduction: The technological economy, Economy and Society, 31, 2, pp. 175-193, (2002); Conservation and Biodiversity Banking A Guide to Setting Up and Running Biodiversity Credit Trading Systems, (2008); Business Biodiversity Offsets and Bbop an Overview, (2009); Standard on Biodiversity Offsets, (2012); Resource Paper no Net Loss and Loss Gain Calculations in Biodiversity Offsets, (2012); Berndt, Christian, Geographies of circulation and exchange: Constructions of markets, Progress in Human Geography, 33, 4, pp. 535-551, (2009)",,Routledge info@tandf.co.uk,,13563467; 14699923,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051991702,

However, as set out in the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB)/International Accounting Standards Board's (IASB) Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements (APS/PS 2), qualitative external factors such as the industry in which the entity operates and investor expectations may make such risks ‘material’ and warrant disclosures when preparing financial statements, regardless of their numerical impact.

Currently, however, lenders lack any detailed guidance for assessing natural capital credit risk in agriculture and are challenged by the fact that the relevant material risks vary considerably by agricultural sector and geography. This paper develops a natural capital credit risk assessment framework based on a bottom-up review of the material risks associated with natural capital impacts and dependencies for Australian beef production. It demonstrates that implementing natural capital credit risk assessment is feasible in agricultural lending, using a combination of quantitative and qualitative inputs.

Banking is an important component in the same and adoption of sustainable banking practices by various banking institutions is a strong driver to achieve sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to study the level of adoption of sustainable banking tools and the extent to which banking institutions practice the same in India. In addition, the banking institutions have been ranked and categorised on basis of their sustainable banking performance. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework focuses on the environmental and social conduct of the banks, who address the issues of sustainability in Indian banking sector. As there is a difference in the economic standards of developed and developing countries, the review of literature helps to figure out the gap in specific frameworks for assessing sustainable banking practices in developing countries. Previous researchers have made an attempt to develop a general framework for assessing the sustainable banking efforts of the banking sector. These studies fall short of indicators on the social dimension of sustainability specifically in the context of less developed countries like India, the social dimensions are is equally a major thrust area along with environmental indicators. Content analysis technique has been used to evaluate sustainable banking performance of the banks and Mann–Whitney U test used to determine the differences in sustainable banking performance of the banks in India. Findings: In Indian banking sector, the adoption of the international sustainability code of conduct is still in its nascent stage. The research indicates that sustainability issues which are of the highest priority for the banks are directly related to their business operations such as financial inclusion, financial literacy and energy efficiency, and banks are more focussed on addressing social dimension of sustainability in banking rather than important dimensions of sustainable banking, namely, environmental management, development of green products and services and sustainability reporting. Practical implications: The application of the proposed framework reflects the status quo of sustainable banking in India. This study is useful for the banks and all the stakeholders in understanding more about the shortcomings in integrating sustainability issues in banking. Further, the present study also redresses the extant research dearth in the field of sustainable banking in the Indian context. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies evaluating the sustainable banking performance of the Indian banking sector. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Nonfinancial Performance; Responsible Banking; Sustainability Reporting; Sustainable Banking; Sustainable Banking Performance Framework; Sustainable Development,,,"Society and Business Review, (2008); Adams, Carol A., Integrating sustainability reporting into management practices, Accounting Forum, 32, 4, pp. 288-302, (2008); Strategic Implications of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability in the Uk Banking Sector, (2005); Babiak, Kathy M., CSR and environmental responsibility: Motives and pressures to adopt green management practices, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 18, 1, pp. 11-24, (2011); Asian Journal of Research in Business Economics and Management, (2012); Bapat, Dhananjay Madhukar, Efficiency for Indian public sector and private sector banks in India: Assessment of impact of global financial crisis, International Journal of Business Performance Management, 13, 3-4, pp. 330-340, (2012); Scaling Up Microfinance for India S Rural Poor, (2005); International Journal of Business Insights Transformation, (2010); Business Spectrum, (2011); Bose, Sudipta, What drives green banking disclosure?

In order to develop a holistic tool for organizational sustainability management, it is imperative to account for, and integrate, the sustainability best practices in the conceptual models. The primary objective of this work is to explore the organizational sustainability themes, functional areas, and the corresponding best practices of the most sustainable organizations. Based on the results, we aim to propose a framework which can support the theoretical models. The starting set of 100 most sustainable organizations is obtained through a well-defined sustainability ranking, Global 100. A systematic method is developed and applied to screen the organizational reports between 2012 and 2016. As a result, 61 reports of 20 organizations are selected for review. We used grounded mechanism to conduct the review. The results of the review indicate that the most sustainable organizations rely on the following nine themes to advance their sustainability performance: (i) resource optimization and minimization of waste and emissions; (ii) business and operational excellence; (iii) corporate citizenship and social development; (iv) research and innovation; (v) procurement, supply chain, and logistics; (vi) governance; (vii) sustainability management tools; (viii) employee relations; and (ix) health, wellness, safety, and security. In addition, there are around 38 functional areas which are of great significance to sustainability managers from an applied perspective and to researchers for constructing sustainability management models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Knights; Corporate Sustainability; Organizational Sustainability; Sustainability Best Practices; Sustainability Management; Best Management Practice; Conceptual Framework; Corporate Strategy; Exploration; Literature Review; Organizational Framework; Ranking; Sustainability; Sustainable Development,best management practice; conceptual framework; corporate strategy; exploration; literature review; organizational framework; ranking; sustainability; sustainable development,,"Business of Sustainability, (2011); Hong, Paul C., Benchmarking sustainability practices: Evidence from manufacturing firms, Benchmarking, 19, 4, pp. 634-648, (2012); Stewart, Raphaëlle, Exploration of the Barriers to Implementing Different Types of Sustainability Approaches, Procedia CIRP, 48, pp. 22-27, (2016); Nawaz, Waqas, Development of a systematic framework for sustainability management of organizations, Journal of Cleaner Production, 171, pp. 1255-1274, (2018); Sealy, Ian M., Sustainable development management systems in global business organizations, Management Research Review, 33, 11, pp. 1083-1096, (2010); Addison, Prue Frances Elizabeth, Practical solutions for making models indispensable in conservation decision-making, Diversity and Distributions, 19, 5-6, pp. 490-502, (2013); Adams, Carol A., Engaging with organisations in pursuit of improved sustainability accounting and performance, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 20, 3, pp. 333-355, (2007); Kurucz, Elizabeth C., Relational leadership for strategic sustainability: practices and capabilities to advance the design and assessment of sustainable business models, Journal of Cleaner Production, 140, pp. 189-204, (2017); Sustainability Practices that Influence Profitability in the Petroleum Industry, (2017); Making Sustainability Work Best Practices in Managing and Measuring Corporate Social Environmental and Economic Impacts, (2008)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070753629,

This paper aims to estimate the potential impact such a policy intervention may have on both capital reserves of European banks and the cost and availability of capital to “green” and “brown” investments. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on the existing empirical and theoretical literature on the impacts of changes to capital reserve requirements on the real economy. It applies these estimates on the particular policy intervention currently being discussed at EU level to estimate the potential range of impacts on the cost of capital – measured in basis points – and the availability of capital – measured in per cent changes to lending. Findings: A GSF would have a limited effect on overall capital requirements of banks compared to a BP – given the larger universe of assets on which such a penalty would be applied. The estimated effect is a reduction in capital requirements associated with a GSF of around €3-4bn based on baseline “green” definitions. In terms of cost of capital, the paper estimates a reduction of 5 to 26 basis points for green projects (with inverse expected effects for a BP). In terms of availability of capital, analysing a BP suggests a potential reduction in lending to brown assets of up to 8 per cent.

However, as previous studies and day-to-day interactions with local leaders make clear, identifying ways to resource adaptation is one of the most significant barriers to progress. This paper draws on selected findings from a study that aimed to better describe the nature of the adaptation finance challenges local governments face so as to find ways to overcome them. Building on initial findings from an online survey and nine stakeholder workshops to deepen the understanding of the nature of funding and financing challenges for local governments, we use a methodological innovation in archetype analysis, grounded theory, to develop a suite of 15 archetypal adaptation finance challenges, i.e., repeatedly found patterns of interrelated causal factors, traits, and outcomes ranging from establishing a matter of concern worthy of attention (and funding) to acquiring, using, and managing adaptation finance. These archetypes are found across different types and sizes of local governments facing different climate change threats. The resulting deeper understanding of local adaptation funding challenges represents an important contribution to the literature and opens up new avenues for intervention beyond the prevailing focus on creating new funding vehicles. We offer archetypespecific recommendations to overcome or reduce these critical finance challenges in local climate change adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Archetype Analysis; Barriers; California; Climate Change Adaptation; Finance; Local Governme; Adaptation; Climate Change; Financial Services; Local Government; Public Spending; California; United States,adaptation; climate change; financial services; local government; public spending; California; United States,"Funding text 1: Proving the financial standing (capacity) of the funding seeker;; Funding text 2: The research team would like to thank the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) for funding support for this project and Jamie Anderson, DWR, and Michael McCormick, Office of Planning and Research (OPR) for advice along the way.

Academics and policymakers have long viewed mandatory information disclosure as a powerful regulatory tool for improving corporate environmental performance, with some going so far as to call environmental information regulation the third phase of American environmental law. Current thinking on environmental information regulation has failed, however, to keep pace with recent transformations in the investment community. Over the past decade, sustainable investing has rapidly movedfrom the fringes of the investment world to the mainstream as an increasing number of investors seek to align their values with the holdings of their portfolios. We argue that environmental information regulation, in the form of a mandatory corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure regime, could significantly facilitate this broader realignment of capital markets with sustainability principles. As we explain, standard models of environmental information regulation are ill-equipped to address the information needs of today's investment community. Instead, this Article calls for a new design of environmental information regulation capable of harnessing mainstream investor interest in sustainability-and, in doing so, creating a new vector of leverage in support of a sustainable future for our society. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"U Colo L Rev, (2005); Karkkainen, Bradley C., Information as Environmental Regulation: TRI and Performance Benchmarking, Precursor to a New Paradigm?, Georgetown Law Journal, 89, 2, (2001); Kleindorfer, Paul R., Informational regulation of environmental risks, Risk Analysis, 18, 2, pp. 155-170, (1998); Sunstein, Cass R., Informational regulation and informational standing: Akins and beyond, University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 147, 3, (1999); Frontiers of Environmental Economics, (2001); Tul L Rev, (2013); N Y U Envtl L J, (2008); Capital University Law Review, (2001); Esty, Daniel C., Environmental protection in the information age, New York University Law Review, 79, 1, pp. 115-211, (2004); Fung, Archon, Reinventing environmental regulation from the grassroots up: Explaining and expanding the success of the toxics release inventory, Environmental Management, 25, 2, pp. 115-127, (2000)",,Yale Journal on Regulation cdo.law@yale.edu,,23765925; 07419457,,,,English,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071763041,

We assess direct funding to United Nations and non-UN organizations to examine three key questions. First, how much does each funder contribute to each organization? Second, what is the relative importance of each funder to each organization? Third, how do funding allocations compare to objective benchmarks like share of donor country income, share of world income and share of world population? We find that a small number of countries provide a majority of total funding and a small number of organizations account for a majority of total resources received. Only a handful of countries are the top funders to at least one organization, but a variety of mid- and smaller-sized economies play larger relative roles in some smaller organizations. Estimating funders’ flows across organizations allows for assessment of their revealed preferences among multilateral priorities and enables comparison against objective benchmarks for burden-sharing.

Scenario development embodies future scenarios that incorporate the uncertainties regarding the decision values and technological alternatives. Policy portfolio planning is used to assess the selected policy alternatives under each scenario and to develop a robust and responsive plan. We organized first- and second-tier committees of 10-12 experts from diverse professional fields to undertake environmental sustainability policy planning in Taiwan. The first-tier committee generated three scenarios: ""live at the mercy of the elements"", ""industry convergence"", and ""technology pilot"". The second-tier committee ensured that, from cradle-to-cradle (C2C), green supply chain management (GSCM), and industry symbiosis (IS), life-cycle type policies enhance green willingness and capabilities in the businesses. This is the first study to consider the first-tier process with scenario development and the second-tier process with policy portfolio planning for environmental sustainability, and contributes by considering intuitive logics approach-based scenarios and robust policies for extant portfolio plans, providing life-cycle- type policy profiles in environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Sustainability Policy; Green Supply Chain Management; Policy Portfolio Planning; Scenario Development; Scenario Planning; Business Development; Decision Making; Environmental Planning; Environmental Policy; Expert System; Life Cycle Analysis; Scenario Analysis; Supply Chain Management; Sustainability; Uncertainty Analysis; Taiwan,business development; decision making; environmental planning; environmental policy; expert system; life cycle analysis; scenario analysis; supply chain management; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; Taiwan,"Funding: This research was funded by the Academic Top Program (three years program) of National Taipei University, grant number 106-NTPU_A-H-162-002 and 107-NTPU_A-H-162-002.","Technology Portfolio Planning and Management, (2006); Amer, Muhammad, A review of scenario planning, Futures, 46, pp. 23-40, (2013); Bentham, Jeremy B., The scenario approach to possible futures for oil and natural gas, Energy Policy, 64, pp. 87-92, (2014); Sharma, Ravi S., A Hybrid Scenario Planning Methodology for Interactive Digital Media, Long Range Planning, 48, 6, pp. 412-429, (2015); Statistics Environmental Loading; Lee, Tsungchen, Bottom-up approach for downscaling CO2 emissions in Taiwan: robustness analysis and policy implications, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 61, 4, pp. 656-676, (2018); Khalili, Nasrin R., Application of multi-criteria decision analysis in design of sustainable environmental management system framework, Journal of Cleaner Production, 47, pp. 188-198, (2013); Moss, Richard H., The next generation of scenarios for climate change research and assessment, Nature, 463, 7282, pp. 747-756, (2010); Durance, Philippe, Scenario building: Uses and abuses, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77, 9, pp. 1488-1492, (2010); Nair, Sujith, Emergence of green business models: The case of algae biofuel for aviation, Energy Policy, 65, pp. 175-184, (2014)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066942896,

This pressure may result in changes in the function of ecological systems and associated ecosystem services, resulting in changes in the benefits derived by people. The loss of natural capital also translates into economic and business risk. While advances have been made to understand and classify ecosystem services, the linkages between such services and the natural capital assets that combine to enable service provision are less well established. An agreed classification of natural capital assets is required to standardise their identification, description and measurement, and support action to reduce and mitigate the pressures they are under. Here, we evaluate the main systems classifying the environment into natural capital assets, against a number of requirements for decision making, showing that to date, we lack a unified classification encompassing all aspects of the natural environment. We have thus amended and consolidated existing classifications and propose a new hierarchical classification, which allows standardisation of use within public and private sector natural capital assessments. Promoting a common understanding is key in measuring and monitoring the value of assets and will enable more consistent and holistic decision making in relation to the management of natural capital. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Benefits; Classification; Ecosystem Service; Flow; Goods; Hierarchical,,This paper reports research results from a project between UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre and the Natural Capital Finance Alliance (a collaboration between UN Environment Finance Initiative and Global Canopy).

However, there are significant challenges in galvanising the investment community used to conventional securities and other investment market instruments. Our article proposes using technological innovations in fund-raising, observed in the initial coin offerings (ICOs) market, to transform the asset class of sustainable and social finance in order to achieve greater marketization, creating an integrated form of social-commercial value for a variety of different investors, from conventional to crowdsourced marketplaces. Key to our proposal is the innovation of tokenisation introduced in ICOs. We argue that tokenisation holds transformative potential for restructuring investment opportunities, as assets need not be tied to the expectations and obligations of conventional financial value creation. Tokens can offer different classes of financial and non-financial rights and rewards. We propose that sustainable and social finance can be raised by corporate structures dedicated to sustainable or social purposes, as dual-class offerings. One class of tokens allows holders to commit to the sustainable or social ends and exercise governance rights as part of their investment. Such token-holders are also expected to be long-term investors and subject to lock-in periods, in order to support the ultimate fulfilment of the sustainable or social project. The other class of tokens would carry no governance rights but be immediately tradeable. This class of tokens likely attracts more transient investors but would provide an important source of finance for sustainable and social projects. The success of ICOs reflects the importance of market conditions and liquidity for this class of investors and we make some proposals as to how such markets can be made more robust by appropriate regulation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hybrid Value Creation; Initial Coin Offerings; Social Finance; Sustainable Finance; Tokenisation; Tokens,,,"Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law, (2009); Abner, David J., The ETF handbook: How to value and trade exchange-traded funds, pp. 1-364, (2016); Environmental Law Review, (2014); Adhami, Saman, Why do businesses go crypto?

Given the socially constructed nature of risk, a risk-based pricing approach prioritizes insurer values and business practices over all societal value goals expressly limiting democratic inclusion in decision-making about risk. As a step towards the more democratically inclusive approach of risk governance, this article uses the state of Florida as a case study to provide a narrative of the social and political context for the evolution of the idea of U.S. hurricane risk. I argue that today’s hurricane risk is a product of long-standing shared efforts to build prosperity. However, it is no longer a simple risk for society to overcome on its way to economic well-being.

Articles on sustainable investment published in journals indexed at the Web of Science during 1989 and 2018 (so far) are reviewed for the purpose of this research. A total of 225 papers were found through the search criteria, out of which 213 papers were selected for review. The paper identifies gaps in the literature that can be considered as opportunities for future study. The analysis of these articles led us to note the need for an agenda that can present a holistic framework of sustainable investment with lesser variations and increased acceptability. The research agenda proposed by the paper may help researchers in framing their research problems around the gaps identified. Sustainable investment is a potential solution to social and ecological issues by transforming the financial markets to have more accountability for their impacts. Therefore, it is important to carry out extensive research in this field so as to develop it as an applied field of investment.

For a long time this has been acknowledged by the insurance sector. Through their expertise in policgecy design, risk assessment, management, loss prevention, claims handling, and responsible investment, the insurance sector has the potential to bridge the gap between climate change science and stakeholder expectations. Therefore, their role is critical with regard to knowledge transfer and climate change resilience. This chapter investigates the role of insurers in bridging the gap between climate change science, manifested in international climate change targets and goals, and actors on different institutional levels in different locations around the world that need to respond to the climate targets and goals. Five different types of knowledge-action gaps which insurers may bridge are explored: (1) the gap between scientific knowledge and policy making, (2) between “North” and the “South,” (3) between the rich and the poor, (4) between global, regional, and local knowledge, and (5) between scientific knowledge and public awareness. The role of insurers in bridging the gaps is explored in the context of climate change impacts on the insurance sector and the consequent actions.

In the case of economic loss, the right insurance coverage reduces the likelihood of financial impacts and is thus critical for climate change resilience. The insurance industry is highly exposed to climate change but is also able to offer solutions and a wide range of actions to tackle climate change adaptation issues. Therefore, many insurers are leaders in terms of how they help address climate adaptation for private entities. Many actors and institutions are calling for a proactive approach from different private entities, such as insurers, to help deal with climate change, but barriers to action are evident. This chapter explores the concept of isolation as a barrier to insurers’ awareness, role, and actions. It derives from a wide range of factors, that isolation can be divided into a number of forms: (1) geographical, (2) political, (3) knowledge, (4) communication, (5) competitive, (6) technological, (7) institutional size, and (8) customer-related isolation. Many of these barriers have factors and impacts which are interrelated. Findings suggest that multistakeholder and public-private partnership solutions may be used to overcome barriers of isolation, thereby reinforcing resilience. Particular examples are used to illustrate the barriers such as recent legislative developments (the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures), growth of leading industry collaborations (Principles for Sustainable Insurance), and private-public partnership growth (city-resilience platform). The identification of the isolation factors are of relevance for academia, policymakers, and industry practitioners as it allows for further studies of the topic and may influence actions of policy-makers regulating business and practitioners’ addressing the isolation issues recognized in this chapter. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Barrier; Climate Change; Insurance; Isolation; Resilience; Stakeholder,,,"Climate Change 2007 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2007); Role of the Insurance Industry in Environmental Policy in the Nordic Countries, (2011); Bazerman, Max H., Climate change as a predictable surprise, Climatic Change, 77, 1-2, pp. 179-193, (2006); Berkhout, Frans G.H., Learning to adapt: Organisational adaptation to climate change impacts, Climatic Change, 78, 1, pp. 135-156, (2006); Biesbroek, Robbert, Europe adapts to climate change: Comparing National Adaptation Strategies, Global Environmental Change, 20, 3, pp. 440-450, (2010); Estimation of Co2 Emissions from Fires in Dwellings Schools and Cars in the Nordic Countries, (2009); Insuring Against the Risk from Insurance, (2017); Nordic Insurance Companies Meet the Challenge of Climate Change Statement from the Nordic Insurance Industry Adopted at the Nordic Insurers Climate Conference in Copenhagen 17 Sept 2009, (2009); Nordic Report 2010 on Behalf of 534 Investors with Assets of US 64 Trillion, (2010); Cassells, Sue M., An exploration of ISO 14001 uptake by New Zealand firms, International Journal of Law and Management, 54, 5, pp. 345-363, (2012)",,Springer International Publishing,,,9783319933368; 9783319933351,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85162629441,

In doing so, the paper will draw on data from an empirical qualitative study that traced the involvement of social movements in shaping three major legal CFDs, namely project finance, bond finance and pension finance on the sustainable finance market between 2015 and 2018. It will argue that social movements, who are, by tradition, in conflict with dominant paradigms, pose a perceptible competitive challenge to major stakeholders who shape the finance dynamics. Whilst the utilisation of the trustworthiness analytical framework proves useful in uncovering the conflict, it serves the main purpose of demonstrating the analytic competition between social movements and the major stakeholders. The author argues that social movements should take a more responsible stance towards sustainable finance and, logically, adopt a form of responsible principles that will govern their relationship with the major stakeholders shaping the CFDs. Further, the author drafts principles in this chapter and argues that, if adopted by social movements, these will improve their competitive advantage on the fast-paced sustainable finance market. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Environmental and Social Framework, (2016); Financing and Investment Impact Assessment Framework, (2018); Transition in Thinking the Impact of Climate Change on the Uk Banking Sector, (2018); Tacit Knowledge in Organisations, (1999); Principles of Sociology, (1939); Our Common Future, (1987); Carroll, Archie B., The business case for corporate social responsibility: A review of concepts, research and practice, International Journal of Management Reviews, 12, 1, pp. 85-105, (2010); Demanding Accountability Civil Society Claims and the World Bank Inspection Panel, (2003); Collins, Harry M., Tacit knowledge, trust and the Q of Sapphire, Social Studies of Science, 31, 1, pp. 71-85, (2001); Crossley, Nick, Even newer social movements?

The coal demand of the main consumer, China, has peaked in 2013 and is slowly declining. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has excluded coal-related companies for ethical reasons. Important players like the UN or the EU have already begun to describe pathways towards de-carbonization. Increasing competition between coal mining companies and the mining regions can be expected worldwide if companies want to keep their positions on the global and national coal markets. Com-panies will focus on the best deposits. European countries like France, Spain or Germany are only forerunners of this development - their centuries of coal production have been finished. The concept of Sustainable Development (SD) is fundamentally based on a model of progress where ecological, economic and social dimensions should be developed equally and positively. But without the idea of competition, the concept of SD is incomplete. Questions arise, such as: How can SD be realized on stagnating or declining markets without guarantees for companies ""to live forever""? How can SD be a corporate goal in a phase of decline? How can declining min-ing regions sustainably progress into a better future? The German hard coal mining industry's lifecycle has ended in 2018 after 60 years of stagnation and decline. As of 2019, all hard coal consumed in Germany will be imported, especially from Colombia, Russia and South Africa. What has been done in Germany to handle the coal decline in a sustainable way and the lessons learned from this process is described in this paper. It may be useful for mining regions who will face a similar future sooner or later. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coal; Mining Regions; Sustainable Development; Transi-tion; Anthracite; Carbonization; Coal; Coal Mines; Commerce; Life Cycle; Planning; Sustainable Development; Coal Production; European Countries; Hard Coal Mining; National Coals; Product Life Cycles; Social Dimensions; Sovereign Wealth Funds; Transi-tion; Coal Industry,Anthracite; Carbonization; Coal; Coal mines; Commerce; Life cycle; Planning; Sustainable development; Coal production; European Countries; Hard coal mining; National coals; Product life cycles; Social dimensions; Sovereign wealth funds; Transi-tion; Coal industry,,"Bpea Conference Drafts, (2018); Sylvicultura Oeconomica Anweisung Zur Wilden Baum Zucht Economic Forestry Instruction to Wild Tree Breeding, (2020); undefined, (2018); 2017 Egca Shortlist, (2017); undefined, (2018); Post Mining Conference Tagung Nachbergbauzeit in Nrw 2015 Grubenwasserkonzept Fur Das Ruhrrevier, (2015); Studieren Und Leben Am Wasser Studying and Living Next to the Water, (2012); World Economic Forum, (2017); Iddri and Climate Strategies, (2017); Fuhrung Von Bergbauunternehmen, (2000)",,"Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration theng@smenet.org 12999 E Adam Aircraft Circle Englewood,Colorado 80112 Colorado",,,9.78151E+12,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084012205,

The above claim perfectly confirms the importance of the coal mining industry to the country economy. With increasing dependency of the country on coal resource for power generation, all indications show that coal exploration in the country will not be abated in near time. The exploration, however, has detrimental effects both on the flora and the fauna as well as the humans. This study, therefore, evaluates the impacts of coal mining in South Africa relative to achieving society 4.0 in the country. Mpumalanga province was used as a case study as mining activities are highly prevalent in this area. Impacts of the mining activities on air pollution and water pollution were reviewed in the study area. The study further develops a roadmap towards achieving Society 4.0 in the era of societal revolution, thus achieving the low carbon global paradigm shift. This study concludes on the need for cleaner substitute for coal in the country as a long-term recommendation and on a short-term sustainability scale, we discourage opencast mining and encourage underground mining of the resource. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coal Mining; Environmental Degradation; Society 4.0; South Africa,,,"Regional Economic Effects of Changes in South Africa S Electricity Generation Mix, (2018); World Coal Institute, (2012); How Environment Plays A Role in Our Lives, (2010); National Environmental Management Act, (1998); Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the Republic of South African, (1996); Utilization Potential of Coal from the Waterberg Coalfield Aspects of Utilization, (1994); Dunmade, Israel S., A streamlined life cycle assessment of a coal-fired power plant: the South African case study, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 26, 18, pp. 18484-18492, (2019); Facts and Figures, (2004); Geological Survey Report no 1987 0154, (1987); Coal Today Black Gold, (2012)",,IEOM Society ieom-society@iieom.org,EATON Powering Business worldwide; Sheridan; SIEMENS; UNIVERSITY of DERBY; UNIVERSITY of Windsor,21698767,9781792361258; 9781532359507; 9780985549756; 9780985549770; 9781532359491; 9781792361234; 9781532359453; 9781532359460; 9781532359514; 9781792361265,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079269647,

The article is supposed to explore the potentials of banks in the conditions of sustainable economic development and to identify the development directions of the reports published by banks. Methodology/Approach: To achieve this goal, firstly, we need to describe the essence of the concept of sustainable development and the challenges facing the Russian economy that impede the more active promotion of the values of this concept in Russia. Secondly, we need to consider the main currently existing initiatives that promote the sustainable development goals and reporting published by Russian commercial banks in the context of sustainable development, and thirdly, to describe the directions for the formation of reporting by banks in the framework of achieving the sustainable development goals through principles and criteria, essential for an objective assessment. Findings: The problem of sustainable development, the spur for the emergence of which was the concept of sustainable development, as a factor in assessing the state of banking activity has been actively studied. In this regard, the authors sequentially studied the reporting published by the largest banks in Russia in terms of assets, highlighted the problems in the formation of reports by commercial banks regarding sustainable development and presented the principles and criteria for its formation. Practical implications: The results of this research can be involved in the process of systematization of the results of the activities of Russian banks in achieving sustainable development goals in the framework of bank reporting. Originality/Value: The main contribution of this article lies in the fact that the study of the problems of bank reporting in the context of economic, environmental and social sustainability presented in the scientific literature is based on standard appraisal forms without focus on the goals of implementing the concept of sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking; Criteria; Principles; Reporting; Sustainable Development Concept,,,"Green Bond Issuance May Reach 250bn in 2019, (2019); Sustainable Development in Russia, (2013); Russian Banking Sectors Review, (2019); 130 Banks Holding Usd 47 Trillion in Assets Commit to Climate Action and Sustainability, (2019); Green Bond Milestone Global Issuance Surpasses 100 Billon in First Half of 2019, (2019); Issakova, Sara Abdrashidovna, Preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, European Research Studies Journal, 20, 3, pp. 458-469, (2017); Principles for Responsible Banking, (2019); Rating of Key Performance Indicators of Russian Banks, (2019); Rupeika-Apoga, Ramona, Bank stability: The case of Nordic and non-Nordic banks in Latvia, International Journal of Economics and Business Administration, 6, 2, pp. 39-55, (2018); Sberbank Pjsc Annual Report, (2017)",,International Strategic Management Association thalassi@unipi.gr,,22414754,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079180754,

This study examines the impact of total natural disasters on the number of endangered species (fish, mammal, bird and plants) for a sample of 110 countries in the year 2015. Ordinary least squares and quantile regression are employed to explain the relationship between occurrences of total disasters and species in danger for these countries. The OLS results suggest that the occurrences of natural disasters exhibit positive relationship with biodiversity loss. Our further analysis using quantile regression study suggest that countries with lower biodiversity loss are more likely to experience decrease of endangered plants with the increasing number of natural disaster occurrences as compared to countries with higher biodiversity loss. These countries will also experience more loss in birds in danger when the population grows. In addition, countries with higher biodiversity loss are more likely to face decrease in threatened birds due to the increase in the percentage of the protected area and income per capita as compared to countries with lower biodiversity loss. However, all the variables have no significance influence on the threatened fish species. Urban population growth effect on threatened mammals is greater at higher quantiles whereas the effect of income per capita is much greater in the countries with higher biodiversity loss but after a certain point, the income per capita decreases with higher biodiversity loss. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biodiversity Loss; Quantile Regression; Species,,,"Abe, Tetsuto, Colonization of Nishino-shima Island by plants and arthropods 31 years after eruption, Pacific Science, 60, 3, pp. 355-365, (2006); Balmford, Andrew P., The convention on biological diversity's 2010 target, Science, 307, 5707, pp. 212-213, (2005); Bhuiyan, Miraj Ahmed, The impact of climate change and energy resources on biodiversity loss: Evidence from a panel of selected Asian countries, Renewable Energy, 117, pp. 324-340, (2018); Bryan, Scott Edward, Rapid, long-distance dispersal by pumice rafting, PLOS ONE, 7, 7, (2012); Tsunami Threat Research and Technology, (2011); Costanza, Robert, Biodiversity and ecosystem services: A multi-scale empirical study of the relationship between species richness and net primary production, Ecological Economics, 61, 2-3, pp. 478-491, (2007); Crawford, Evan, Energy-dependent electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry of carbonyl clusters, Journal of Cluster Science, 17, 1, pp. 47-63, (2006); de Meester, Luc, Challenges for biodiversity research in Europe, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 13, pp. 83-100, (2011); Dietz, Simon, Economic growth, biodiversity loss and conservation effort, Journal of Environmental Management, 68, 1, pp. 23-35, (2003); Dudgeon, David, Freshwater biodiversity: Importance, threats, status and conservation challenges, Biological Reviews, 81, 2, pp. 163-182, (2006)",,Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,,01271962; 27166058,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074948116,

Of particular note is the proliferation of corporate regulation to govern “socially responsible” behavior in recent legislative reforms in the EU and U.K. In seeking to answer the broader question of whether corporate regulation indeed effectively governs and moderates corporate behavior, this paper focuses on the nature of corporate regulation. Although different pieces of corporate regulation purport to achieve different objectives and impose different types of obligations, this paper offers an institutional account of corporate regulation, specifically in relation to the U.K.‘s regulatory capitalism, as the U.K. is typically held up as having a liberal market economy (which is broadly similar to the U.S.). In this article, I argue that the nature and effectiveness of corporate regulation crucially depends on the nature of regulatory capitalism in the type of economic order under discussion. Hence the study of the U.K.‘s economic order and its efforts in introducing corporate regulation to change corporate behavior holds lessons more generally for corporate regulation in economies that share similar features. The examination in this article provides an overarching framework for distilling the achievements and limitations of corporate regulation in such economic contexts. First, the paper clarifies that regulatory capitalism in the U.K. is characterized by three key tenets that reflect the spirit of the liberal market economy embraced here. Over time, gaps have been revealed in the achievements of these tenets of regulatory capitalism, particularly in relation to social expectations of the regulation of corporate behavior. These gaps have become the subject of debates in the realm of “corporate social responsibility” (CSR), where business, civil society, and the state frame the expectations of corporate behavior in contested ways: in relation to the scope of responsibility, the motivations for corporate behavior, the theoretical premises, and business practices. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2007-2009, we observe increasing legalization in the EU and U.K. of CSR issues, framed in “new governance” regulatory techniques. They hold promise for change in corporate conduct through deeper forms of corporate engagement and accountability, but they appear at the same time relatively undemanding and susceptible to cosmetic compliance. By discussing key examples in new corporate regulation reforms in the EU and U.K., we seek to understand why recent corporate regulation reforms seem to offer mixed and, in some cases, relatively limited achievements in governing corporate behavior. We argue that the institutional account of corporate regulation continues to be able to explain regulatory weaknesses and limited achievements, in spite of the deployment of “new governance” regulatory techniques. This is because new governance regulatory techniques are implemented within the ethos of regulatory capitalism which limits their potential to introduce paradigm shifts. However, the limitations of these regulatory reforms highlight more sharply the institutional shifts that are needed in order to connect the efficacy of corporate regulation with meeting social expectations. new governance regulatory techniques.

In this respect, the role of the banking sector, among other critical business entities and key stakeholders, is vital. The purpose of our paper is to examine how comprehensively the reported performance of banks aligns with the endorsement of SDGs. We employ the well-established framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) performance indicators for a comparative assessment of the nonfinancial performance disclosed in the annual sustainability reports. Focusing on a small sample of leading European banks, we find an overall low contribution to SDGs. Furthermore, each bank's contribution remains particularly heterogeneous towards most individual SDG goals. Likewise, bank-specific strategies drive the most extensively addressed SDGs, overlooking any critical importance of certain GRI indicators with multifaceted impact across several SDGs. The study sets forth managerial implications for improving effective reporting of SDG performance. It concludes with emerging opportunities for enhancing disclosure of SDGs contribution and highlights future research perspectives towards industry-wide shared-value appraisal under the scope of these pressing grand challenges. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banking Sector; Global Reporting Initiative (gri) Guidelines; Sustainability Accounting And Reporting; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Banking; Business; Guideline; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development; Europe,banking; business; guideline; stakeholder; sustainable development; Europe,"Our study proposes a structured framework for comparative assessment of overall organizational operation in terms of contribution to the SDGs.

This paper conducted an empirical analysis on what determines climate finance engagement of financial institutions from the institutionally focused perspective that considers the external pressures and the internal governance. Publicly available information of 102 global financial institutions was used to apply a multiple regression analysis. The results confirm that there is influence of international climate finance initiatives on financial institutions with regard to the mobilisation of climate finance, whereas senior management engagement on climate change also encourages the higher commitment to climate finance from financial institutions. The result leaves behind an important implication for fragmented climate governance: the engagement of climate finance initiatives has a facilitative role to provide pressures on financial institutions to mobilise climate finance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Finance Initiatives; Paris Agreement; Private Climate Finance; Regime Complex; Stakeholder Theory,,,"Abbott, Kenneth W., The transnational regime complex for climate change, Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 30, 4, pp. 571-590, (2012); Abbott, Kenneth W., Strengthening the transnational regime complex for climate change, Transnational Environmental Law, 3, 1, pp. 57-88, (2014); Abbott, Kenneth W., Orchestration: Global governance through intermediaries, pp. 3-36, (2015); Abbott, Kenneth W., The governance triangle: Regulatory standards institutions and the shadow of the state, pp. 44-88, (2009); undefined, (2018); Ayling, Julie, Non-state governance and climate policy: the fossil fuel divestment movement, Climate Policy, 17, 2, pp. 131-149, (2017); Bäckstrand, Karin, The democratic legitimacy of orchestration: the UNFCCC, non-state actors, and transnational climate governance, Environmental Politics, 26, 4, pp. 764-788, (2017); undefined, (2015); Biermann, Frank H.B., Earth system governance' as a crosscutting theme of global change research, Global Environmental Change, 17, 3-4, pp. 326-337, (2007); Biermann, Frank H.B., Global environmental governance: Taking stock, moving forward, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 33, pp. 277-294, (2008)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at,,20430795; 20430809,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065401589,

The deteriorating environment at a rapid rate has raised an alarming demand for immediate steps towards protection of the environment and saving of the environment from further deterioration. Today, developmental activities look only at the economic benefits exploiting the limited natural resources in an unplanned and unchecked manner overlooking the needs of the future, and all industrial sectors in the world economy including the banking sector are facing huge challenges with environmental problems and their related impacts in day-to-day businesses. The banking sector and its role in sustainable development was studied through its new initiative to control environmental pollution in the very beginning level of seeking financial assistance for industrial activities and getting assurance from the proprietors, which is commonly recognized as green banking. In this paper, the effect of geographical locations of the respondents on green banking adoption was also studied through statistical analysis of the data collected using a specially designed questionnaire duly incorporating the factors of green banking.

І., State Educational and Scientific Establishment ‘Academy of Financial Management, Kyiv, Ukraine","Introduction. The scientific substantiation of the updated institutional framework for the integration of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization (BSEC) countries in the context of its gradual transformation into a multilateral integration structure is an urgent issue problem of the present-day reality insofar as in new conditions, there are threatening tendencies towards disrupting the market equilibrium caused by geopolitical factors and aggravated risks of destabilization in the economic activity. Problem Statement. The current state of the hybrid world order is accompanied by the restructuring of international, government, and civil society institutions. Manifestations of uncertainty, conflicting relationships in the Black Sea countries complicate the implementation of European integration reforms aiming at supporting the sustainable development. Purpose. To identify the most relevant areas of required social transformations in BSEC Member States, taking into consideration the fact that the nations have independent interests in terms of possible external and internal threats and impacts. In the economic aspect, this means to ensure employment, solvency of parties to contracts, etc. Materials and Methods. The research is based on a systematic approach, consistent processing of interrelated trends in statistical indices, situational analysis, and synthesis methods. Results. Ways of strengthening the counteraction to destabilization of the economy of the region have been covered. Given its strategic role, it has been proposed to focus on the problems of shaping the future proceeding from the principle of coordination of BSEC scenarios and actions. Conclusions. Collaboration between global and regional players to form a common strategic thinking should focus on funds and tools to transform the Black Sea region from a zone of confrontation into a space for the peaceful convergence of civilization values. Successive measures to reduce the territorial tensions should be adapted to relatively low rates of societies’ perception of the need for compatible reforms to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Economic security; National priorities; Peaceful relations; Sustainable development; The Black Sea region,,,"Volcanic Syndrome, (2018); Finance Development, (2017); Stiglitz Report Reforming the International Monetary and Financial Systems in the Wake of the Global Crisis, (2010); This Time is Different, (2009); Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, (2009); Economy of Ukraine Strategy and Policy of Long Term Development, (2003); Concept of Economic Security of Ukraine, (1999); Modeling of Economic Security State Region Enterprise, (2006); Finanse of Ukraine, (2018); Financial Globalization and European Integration, (2015)",,Publishing House Akademperiodyka,,24099066; 24134996,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079541943,

Yet, this sector often attracts criticisms. Of particular concern is the negligence of proper credit risk management, which may undermine (macro)economic stability. The absence of appropriate policies (industry and institutional) draws attention to firm performance indicators, which remain short-sighted in assessing the provision of sustainable risk management. The sector and, in particular, financial intermediaries (FIs) must confront the complex task of assessing their impacts and, in doing so, actively endorse enabling conditions towards sustainable development. Our paper offers managerial insights from a wide range of financial intermediaries (FIs) currently active in Greece. We address the critical question of how FIs incorporate sustainability in credit risk management. A mixed-methods approach of online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews was utilized to link and investigate managerial perspectives of sustainability risks and their impact on bad loans. The executives' responses revealed that sustainability risk management indeed exists, but it has yet to penetrate core processes. It does provide strong motives over new management techniques and contributes to a higher level of materiality of FI's core operations. Nonetheless, there is still plenty of room for improvement before sustainability risk assessments are comprehensively incorporated in all phases of the credit risk management process so that a robust sustainability management approach underpins FI's core mission and goals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Credit Risk Management; Financial Intermediaries; Greece; Mixed Methods; Sustainability Risk; Credit Provision; Decision Making; Economic Analysis; Financial System; Industrial Policy; Questionnaire Survey; Risk Assessment; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Greece,credit provision; decision making; economic analysis; financial system; industrial policy; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; sustainability; sustainable development; Greece,,"Scholtens, Bert, Corporate social responsibility in the international banking industry, Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 2, pp. 159-175, (2009); J Sustain Financ Investig, (2014); Knyght, Reeves, When rules and principles are not enough: Insiders' views and narratives on the global financial crisis, Journal of Change Management, 11, 1, pp. 45-67, (2011); de Haas, Ralph T.A., Multinational banks and the global financial crisis: Weathering the perfect storm?, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 46, SUPPL.1, pp. 333-364, (2014); Cent Eur Rev Econ Financ, (2012); Rossignolo, Adrián F., Market crises and Basel capital requirements: Could Basel III have been different?

Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis, namely content analysis, entropy based and TOPSIS techniques, have been utilized in order to measure the sustainability performance. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient has been employed to investigate the nexus between overall sustainability performance scores of the banks and market value during the years 2013 and 2015. The results of this study are insignificant in the ongoing debate on whether Turkish banks' sustainability efforts are value related. However, a significant and positive relationship has been found between the financial sustainability performance and the market value in the long run. Additionally, a multidimensional corporate sustainability model that has the five dimensions of economic, environmental, social, governance and financial disclosures has been proposed.

However, it is an open question whether this new asset class is also offering attractive risk–return profiles compared to conventional (non-green) bonds. To address this question, we match daily i-spreads of green-labeled and similar non-green-labeled bonds and look at their pricing differentials. We find that rating classes AA–BBB of green bonds as well as the full sample trade marginally tighter for the respective period compared to non-green bonds of the same issuers. Furthermore, financial and corporate green bonds trade tighter than their comparable non-green bonds, and government-related bonds on the other hand trade marginally wider.

These are mainly based on the pursuit of synergy in the three basic areas of activities, i.e., in the economic, social, and environmental dimensions as well as in the maintenance of natural resources. The implementation of these activities is connected with the necessity of incurring financial expenditures, which the government (public sector) does not have in the required value. Therefore, in the process of sustainable development for which the government is responsible, the active participation of the financial sector (banks) is necessary. Achieving results within the alliance of the concept of sustainable development requires the setting of a kind of contract, the parties of which are the government, society, and financial institutions. The purpose of the conducted research is to indicate by which means the government can stimulate economic growth towards its sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Public Finance; Sustainable Development; Economic Growth; Government; Natural Resource; Public Sector; Sustainable Development; Poland [central Europe],economic growth; government; natural resource; public sector; sustainable development; Poland [Central Europe],,"Ashford, Nicholas, Technology, globalization, and sustainable development: Transforming the industrial state, pp. 1-720, (2011); Primer on the Emergence and Evolution of Sustainable Development 1951 2012, (2012); World Conservation Strategy Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable Development, (1980); World Commission on Environment and Development Our Common Future, (1987); Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, (1992); Sustainable Transportation Indicators Frameworks and Performance Management, (2016); Final Report 2018 by the High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance Secretariat Provided by the European Commission, (2017); King, Robert G., Finance and growth: schumpeter might be right, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108, 3, pp. 717-737, (1993); Inclusive Growth Analytics Framework and Application, (2009); Principles for Positive Impact Finance A Common Framework to Finance the Sustainable Development Goals, (2016)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053415838,

Inarguably, Africa’s susceptibility to climate change is high because it hosts the majority of the world’s poor who cannot afford the costs of coping mechanisms. Agricultural insurance is being largely put forward as a coping measure of adapting to climate change to sustain farm production and farmers’ livelihood. The study critically reviewed numerous publications on climate change impacts and the role of insurance in the adaptation process. It examined the effects of varying weather conditions and insurance on net crop revenue using the instrumental variable regression approach on a Ricardian model. The study further identified factors influencing the purchase of insurance among the farmers with a probit model. The study data were collected from a cross section of farmers in three selected provinces of South Africa. Results of data analysis indicated that owning insurance, number of labourers employed, size of irrigated farmland and rainfall have significant effects on net revenue. It was also revealed that experience, indicated by years of farming and revenue, influenced farmers’ adoption of insurance. Consequently, the paper advocates for the provision of efficient irrigation facilities and promotion of insurance among farmers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Climate Change; Economic Impact; Insurance; South Africa; Variability; Agricultural Products; Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Insurance; Purchasing; Adaptation Process; Climate Change Impact; Climate Variability; Coping Mechanisms; Economic Impacts; Instrumental Variables; South Africa; Variability; Climate Change; Agricultural Management; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Coping Strategy; Crop Production; Economic Impact; Insurance System; Regression Analysis,Agricultural products; Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Insurance; Purchasing; Adaptation process; Climate change impact; Climate variability; Coping mechanisms; Economic impacts; Instrumental variables; South Africa; Variability; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; coping strategy; crop production; economic impact; insurance system; regression analysis,Funding text 1: This research was supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) Programme.

How does this development - along with our efforts to understand it - map onto environmental governance processes in China? China's efforts to address environmental issues reflect institutionalized governance processes that differ from parallel western processes in ways that have major consequences for domestic environmental governance practices and the governance of China “going abroad.” China's governance processes blur the distinction between the state and other actors; the “shadow of the state” is a major factor in all efforts to address environmental issues. The space occupied by nonstate actors in western systems is occupied by shiye danwei (“public service units”), she hui tuanti (“social associations”) and e-platforms, all of which have close links to the state. Meanwhile, international NGOs and multinational corporations are also significant players in China. As a result, the mechanisms of influence that produce effects in China differ in important ways from mechanisms familiar from the western experience. This conclusion has far-reaching implications for those seeking to address global environmental concerns, given the importance of China's growing economy and burgeoning network of trade relationships. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Belt And Road Initiative; Environmental Governance; Nonstate Actors; She Hui Tuanti (“social Group”); Shi Ye Danwei (“public Service Unit”); Economics; Environmental Protection; Belt And Road Initiative; Environmental Governances; Environmental Issues; Environmental Problems; Nonstate Actor; Public Services; Service Units; She Hui Tuanti (“social Group”); Shi Ye Danwei (“public Service Unit”); Social Groups; Space Platforms; Environmental Issue; Environmental Legislation; Governance Approach; Institutional Framework; Management Practice; Nongovernmental Organization; Public Service; Article; China; Economic Aspect; Female; Human; Environmental Policy; Government; Environmental Policy; Government; Government Programs; Humans,Economics; Environmental protection; Belt and road initiative; Environmental governances; Environmental issues; Environmental problems; Nonstate actor; Public services; Service units; She hui tuanti (“social group”); Shi ye danwei (“public service unit”); Social groups; Space platforms; environmental issue; environmental legislation; governance approach; institutional framework; management practice; nongovernmental organization; public service; article; China; economic aspect; female; human; environmental policy; government; Environmental Policy; Government; Government Programs; Humans,,"Constructing Private Governance the Rise and Evolution of Forest Coffee and Fisheries Certification, (2014); undefined, (2015); Workers Sickened at Apple Supplier in China, (2019); undefined, (2009); Bartley, Tim, Looking behind the label: Global industries and the conscientious consumer, pp. 1-287, (2015); undefined, (2014); undefined, (2016); Büthe, Tim, The new global rulers: The privatization of regulation in the world economy, pp. 1-301, (2011); undefined, (2012); Cashore, Benjamin W., Governing through markets: Forest certification and the emergence of non-state authority, pp. 1-327, (2004)",,Academic Press,,03014797; 10958630,,JEVMA,29777995.0,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047149090,

This paper investigates the incentives and consequences underlying this recent shift toward country- or theme-specific funding and away from bilateral and multilateral aid. We propose a game-theoretic model with multiple principals and a multilateral agent to study how the interaction between donor preferences, voter concerns in the donor country, the voting rules at the multilateral organization, and the presence of special purpose trust funds influences aid allocation. We show that multilateral organizations with majority rules are more likely to receive discretion and thus voluntary core contributions than those with unanimity requirements and that the possibility of earmarking multilateral aid decreases donors’ contributions to the multilateral's discretionary core budget and the amount of bilateral aid. In contrast to much of the literature dealing with issues of delegation and bi- and multilateral aid, our model suggests non-monotonic effects of preference heterogeneity on the choice of aid channel for some parameter combinations when contributions to special purpose trust funds are an option. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Collective Principal; Earmarking; Foreign Aid; International Organizations; International Public Finance; Multi-bi Aid; Multilateral Trust Funds; Multiple Principals; Principal–agent; Finance; Incentive; International Aid; International Organization; Parameterization; Voluntary Approach,finance; incentive; international aid; international organization; parameterization; voluntary approach,"Extremely helpful comments by Christopher Kilby, Ryan Powers, Byungwon Woo, and other participants at these events and financial support by the Swiss Network for International Studies are gratefully acknowledged.","World Bank Cfp Working Paper Series, (2009); Alesina, Alberto F., Who gives foreign aid to whom and why?, Journal of Economic Growth, 5, 1, pp. 33-63, (2000); Anesi, Vincent, Earmarked taxation and political competition, Journal of Public Economics, 90, 4-5, pp. 679-701, (2006); Athanassakos, Alex, General fund financing versus earmarked taxes: An alternative model of budgetary choice in a democracy, Public Choice, 66, 3, pp. 261-278, (1990); What is the Track Record of Multi Donor Trust Funds in Improving Aid Effectiveness an Assessment of the Available Evidence, (2012); Bayer, Patrick, Funding global public goods: The dark side of multilateralism, Review of Policy Research, 30, 2, pp. 160-189, (2013); Bayram, A.

One of the most critical problems in modelling those costs is the limited information and the subjectivity used to represent some of the cost's elements (e.g., values, drivers, among others). Thus, a fuzzy ABC approach is incorporated into the methodology to overcome those limitations. The application of this methodology aims at providing an alternative procedure to allocating the costs related to wastewater management activities to products. To validate the proposed methodology and illustrate its utility, a case study using data from a bus assembly plant is provided. Part of the wastewater produced is coming from a surface treatment installation which, after a recovery process, reuse part of the same water in a closed loop circuit. Using the proposed Fuzzy ABC methodology, the costs (including uncertainty) of the surface treatment and water treatment activities can be appropriately allocated to the products that generate those activities and that waste. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Activity-based Costing; Fuzzy Numbers; Surface Treatment; Uncertainty; Water Reuse; Cost; Fuzzy Mathematics; Management Practice; Methodology; Recycling; Uncertainty Analysis; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment,cost; fuzzy mathematics; management practice; methodology; recycling; uncertainty analysis; wastewater; wastewater treatment,,"Burritt, Roger Leonard, Accounting towards sustainability in production and supply chains, British Accounting Review, 46, 4, pp. 327-343, (2014); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance Management Sciences, (2015); Jabbour, Charbel Jose Chiappetta, Environmental management and operational performance in automotive companies in Brazil: The role of human resource management and lean manufacturing, Journal of Cleaner Production, 47, pp. 129-140, (2013); Yang, Maga, Impact of lean manufacturing and environmental management on business performance: An empirical study of manufacturing firms, International Journal of Production Economics, 129, 2, pp. 251-261, (2011); European Journal of Business and Management, (2013); Kim, Jihyun, Economic and environmental cost analysis of incineration and recovery alternatives for flammable industrial waste: The case of South Korea, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 9, (2017); Cagno, Enrico, Eco-efficiency for sustainable manufacturing: An extended environmental costing method, Production Planning and Control, 23, 2-3, pp. 134-144, (2012); Nicolǎescu, Eugen, Measuring corporate sustainability performance, Sustainability (Switzerland), 7, 1, pp. 851-865, (2015); Senthil, Kumaran D., A proposed tool to integrate environmental and economical assessments of products, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 23, 1, pp. 51-72, (2003); Latin Am J Manag Sust Dev, (2015)",,MDPI,,20711050,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049400553,

This chapter reviews the major issues related with low-carbon finance of banks. First, low-carbon finance products of banks are diverse and are categorized into two areas: the retail banking sector as well as corporate and investment banking sectors. Many innovative financial product provided by banks are to introduced in ASEAN context. Second, government can provide several incentives to the private financial sectors. An example of public-private partnership is green certification in Republic of Korea. The leading role of governments is critical. Third, the careful recognition of environment risk for the target projects, banks can provide capital and management incentive to projects with low environment risks effectively. Fourth, in October 2015, UNEP FI released the Positive Impact Menifesto, which calls for a new financing paradigm to bridge the funding gap for sustainable development. Fifth, financial technology or 'fintech' is emerging as a core disruptor of every aspect of today's financial system. UN Environment commissioned an initial landscape review of the potential for fintech to advance sustainable development. Next, the situation of bank finance for low-carbon transition in Republic of Korea was studied in two ways: summarizing the situation of Korean banks during last three governments from 2008 to 2017 and interviewing a Korean expert in low-carbon finance. Based on the theoretical issues and case study of Republic of Korea, the policy recommendations were made for banks in ASEAN countries in four areas: recognition of 'low-carbon' as a new paradigm, leading role of the governments, global linkage of individual banks, and leapfrog by cutting-edge technology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environment Risk Management; Low-carbon Finance Of Bank; Public-private Partnership,,,"Aizawa, Motoko, Green credit, green stimulus, green revolution? china's mobilization of banks for environmental cleanup, Journal of Environment and Development, 19, 2, pp. 119-144, (2010); Low Carbon Green Growth in Asia Policies and Practices, (2013); Bai, Yunwen, The role of china's banking sector in providing green finance, Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum, 24, 1, pp. 89-140, (2013); Banker, (2009); Emergence of Fintech and the Lasic Principles, (2023); G20 Green Finance Synthesis Report, (2016); Green Growth Policy Under APEC, (2009); Green Finance for Green Growth Joint Study Reported to the Finance Ministrial Meeting of APEC, (2011); Public Finance Policy for Green Growth in Asia, (2012); Green Finance, (2013)",,Springer Singapore,,,9789811085819; 9789811085826,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053367611,

Energy savings of the buildings were evaluated based on the added thermal resistance on the roofs and corresponding heat transmission through the roofs. Four different scenarios, two without green financing and two with green consumer loans for retrofitting financed by the central government via the state-owned banks, were studied. The economic impact of this activity on the economy is estimated based on sectoral employment multipliers for a period of 10 years. Based on the scenario analysis and the priorities of the Turkish economy, given the employment benefits and energy savings which would reduce the energy demand in the area in the peak season, we propose that the government implements green consumer loans for retrofitting through the state-owned banks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Economic Impact; Energy Savings; Green Roofs; Policy Implications,,,"Mimarlk, (1972); Proceedings of Zmir Ruzgar Sempozyumu Ve Sergisi, (2011); undefined, (2017); Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum, (2014); Berndtsson, Justyna C., Runoff water quality from intensive and extensive vegetated roofs, Ecological Engineering, 35, 3, pp. 369-380, (2009); Bianchini, Fabricio, Probabilistic social cost-benefit analysis for green roofs: A lifecycle approach, Building and Environment, 58, pp. 152-162, (2012); Blackhurst, Michael F., Cost-effectiveness of green roofs, Journal of Architectural Engineering, 16, 4, pp. 136-143, (2010); Brotman, Billie Ann, The feasibility of medical office building green upgrades from an owner/lessor perspective, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 34, 4, pp. 375-386, (2016); Carter, Timothy L., Life-cycle cost-benefit analysis of extensive vegetated roof systems, Journal of Environmental Management, 87, 3, pp. 350-363, (2008); Castleton, Holly Faye, Green roofs; Building energy savings and the potential for retrofit, Energy and Buildings, 42, 10, pp. 1582-1591, (2010)",,Routledge custser@mesharpe.com,,1540496X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047483702,

Yet, there is limited empirical knowledge about the conditions by which these networks can go beyond knowledge sharing to achieving on the ground. This paper presents two case studies of networks between universities, the private sector, civil society, and decision-makers at the local government level in different African municipalities: Karonga District (Malawi) and the Eden District (South Africa). The chapter considers conditions that enable collaboration to move from knowledge sharing to adaptation action. It does this by demonstrating how the origins of networks, the characteristics of partner organizations, the needs of each partner, the nature of the relationships between partners and the activities of the network, all combine to affect adaptation responses. For example, the high vulnerability of the Eden District to weather hazards prompted a private insurance company to collaborate with academics and local governments to understand how to reduce flood and fire risk to limit their insurance payouts in the region. The insurers invested in early warning systems and better fire response vehicles, as well as in a more holistic strategy of partnership, which has improved risk responses. The experiences presented in this paper highlight why and how networks can integrate knowledge from different partners into decision-making to result in adaptation actions on the ground. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Africa; Collaboration; Municipalities; Networks; Partnerships,,,"Managing within Networks Adding Value to Public Organizations, (2007); Ansell, Christopher K., Collaborative governance in theory and practice, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 18, 4, pp. 543-571, (2008); Journal of Emerging Trends in Economics and Management Sciences Jetems, (2015); Bryson, John M., The design and implementation of cross-sector collaborations: Propositions from the literature, Public Administration Review, 66, SUPPL. 1, pp. 44-55, (2006); Burch, Sarah Lynn M., In pursuit of resilient, low carbon communities: An examination of barriers to action in three Canadian cities, Energy Policy, 38, 12, pp. 7575-7585, (2010); Carter, Jeremy G., Climate change and the city: Building capacity for urban adaptation, Progress in Planning, 95, pp. 1-66, (2015); Networks in Health Care A Comparative Study of their Management Impact and Performance, (2010); Fleishman, Rachel, To participate or not to participate?

While CE can be an important policy tool to promote more sustainable development trajectories, in practice it does not always avoid or mitigate adverse impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services caused by resource extraction and infrastructure development. Here we review the current status of biodiversity protection and CE policy in China, highlighting some of their challenges. We then explore the prospects for market-based biodiversity offsets to address the current shortcomings in existing CE policy. Finally, we propose a conceptual model that incorporates a commitment to no-net-loss mitigation into the overall CE strategy to expand the use of biodiversity offsets in China and to remove some of the deficiencies by involving private enterprises in conservation efforts. This model can be used to analyze a set of parameters for comparing different offsets against one another. We propose that such an integrative framework can help CE policy achieve the intended goal of decoupling economic growth from impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services in China. Important next steps are the implementation of case studies for target industries and ecosystems to demonstrate the synergy between CE and biodiversity offsets and evaluate on-the-ground effectiveness of the proposed integration by adapting our framework. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Economic Growth; Mitigation Banking; Payment For Ecosystem Services; Sustainable Development; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Economics; Environmental Protection; Extraction; Planning; Raw Materials; Sustainable Development; Biodiversity Protection; Economic Growths; Ecosystem Services; Infrastructure Development; Integrative Framework; Mitigation Banking; Raw Material Extraction; Resource Extraction; Ecosystems,Biodiversity; Climate change; Economics; Environmental protection; Extraction; Planning; Raw materials; Sustainable development; Biodiversity protection; Economic growths; Ecosystem services; Infrastructure development; Integrative framework; Mitigation banking; Raw material extraction; Resource extraction; Ecosystems,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant no. 71325006, 71690241 and 71461137008], the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities through Shanghai Jiao Tong University [grant no. 16JCCS04], the Shanghai Municipal Government [grant no.17XD1401800] and Yunnan Provincial Research Academy of Environmental Science.","Pan, Xingliang, Payments for ecosystem services in China: Policy, practice, and progress, Journal of Cleaner Production, 158, pp. 200-208, (2017); Ahlheim, Michael, Replacing rubber plantations by rain forest in Southwest China—who would gain and how much?, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 187, 2, (2015); Alvarado-Quesada, Irene, Market-based mechanisms for biodiversity conservation: A review of existing schemes and an outline for a global mechanism, Biodiversity and Conservation, 23, 1, pp. 1-21, (2014); undefined, (2015); undefined, (2015); Bai, Yang, New ecological redline policy (ERP) to secure ecosystem services in China, Land Use Policy, 55, pp. 348-351, (2016); Ban, Natalie C., A social-ecological approach to conservation planning: Embedding social considerations, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 11, 4, pp. 194-202, (2013); Basta, Nicholas Thomas, Restoring ecosystem function in degraded urban soil using biosolids, biosolids blend, and compost, Journal of Environmental Quality, 45, 1, pp. 74-83, (2016); Standard on Biodiversity Offsets, (2012); BenDor, Todd K., A dynamic analysis of the wetland mitigation process and its effects on no net loss policy, Landscape and Urban Planning, 89, 1-2, pp. 17-27, (2009)",,Elsevier Ltd,,09596526,,JCROE,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046035280,

The article is intended to contribute to the implementation of corporate sustainability practices by presenting a framework or blueprint for insurance companies to follow which will enable them to integrate sustainability goals into their culture, core business, strategy and structure. Findings are based on a case study and interviews involving insurance companies operating in the Nordic region, a follow-up study, and secondary data. On a global level, actions of Nordic insurers include commitments to international agreements, schemes and initiative dealing with environmental issues. On a regional level, actions include collaboration through financial and insurance associations, conferences and publications. National level actions include eco-labelled insurance, commitments and green office programs. Building on earlier literature, and based on the actions of these Nordic insurance companies, a Five C framework for the insurance sector environmental sustainability is developed. The framework identifies five phases in corporate strategy development on the path towards environmental sustainability: (1) commitment, (2) configuration, (3) core business, (4) communication, and (5) continuous improvement. The study findings show that the phases identified in the Five C framework are mainly developed through actions carried out by the larger companies included in the study. The smaller companies appear to be passive or reactive in developing sustainability practices. Therefore, the suggested framework can facilitate positive changes and enable companies with limited resources or those at the early stages of strategy development to learn from sustainability implementation best practices of early adopters. The Five C framework proposed is intended to: (1) help insurance company leaders better understand how, through their actions, they can contribute to industry-wide adoption of sustainability strategies and practices thereby influencing the scale and speed at which these are implemented, and (2) to emphasise the importance of the core business in strategy implementation which has not been adequately addressed in prior academic literature and industry frameworks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Best-practice Example; Environmental Sustainability; Framework; Implementation; Insurance; Strategy; Insurance; Iron And Steel Plants; Lubrication; Planning; Best Practices; Environmental Sustainability; Framework; Implementation; Strategy; Sustainable Development,Insurance; Iron and steel plants; Lubrication; Planning; Best practices; Environmental sustainability; Framework; Implementation; Strategy; Sustainable development,,"Egels-Zandén, Niklas, Sustainable strategy formation at a Swedish industrial company: Bridging the strategy-as-practice and sustainability gap, Journal of Cleaner Production, 96, pp. 139-147, (2015); Financial Institutions Taking Action on Climate Change, (2014); Ambec, Stéfan, Does it pay to be green?

Key under-researched dimensions of this challenge are what promotes private investment in coastal adaptation and how can public actors’ interest in adaptation be aligned with private investor interests. To address this, we review the literatures on coastal adaptation finance and on financial arrangements involving both public actors and private investors. We describe key actors and interests, and identify coastal financial arrangements that align public actor and private investor interests, finding that private provisioning, public–private Partnerships (PPP), and public debt arrangements are promising. We then survey empirical examples, finding that private provisioning attracts investment when returns are high, for example, in urban real estate, and that PPPs attract dredging and construction companies’ investment, particularly for adaptation measures with a large share of operational costs, for example, beach nourishment. We find little evidence of institutional investment through public debt instruments. A number of policy instruments, for example, concessional loans, tax incentives, and standards, may address this gap and enhance private coastal adaptation investment. Our results are also relevant for other sectors that involve long-term infrastructure adaptation measures.

Silvius and Schipper (2014) identify a growing number of publications that study the impact of sustainability on project management. One of the 'impact areas' they identify is the identification and management of risk in the project. This chapter discusses the main concepts of sustainability and their implications for project risk management. The main findings are that the integration of the concepts of sustainability imply (1) A broader identification and considering of risks, expanding the orientation on risks to include also environmental and social perspectives and to consider the full life-cycle of the project's deliverable, impact and resources. (2) Inclusion of (potential) stakeholders in a transparent process of project risk management. And (3) Adopting a social, communicative, approach to risk management, as opposed to the calculating, rational approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Aaltonen, Kirsi, A project lifecycle perspective on stakeholder influence strategies in global projects, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 26, 4, pp. 381-397, (2010); State of the World 2013 is Sustainability Still Possible, (2013); Atkinson, Roger, Fundamental uncertainties in projects and the scope of project management, International Journal of Project Management, 24, 8, pp. 687-698, (2006); Bebbington, Jan, Corporate social reporting and reputation risk management, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 21, 3, pp. 337-361, (2008); Böhm, Gisela, Consequences, morality, and time in environmental risk evaluation, Journal of Risk Research, 8, 6, pp. 461-479, (2005); Brent, Alan Colin, Sustainable life cycle management: Indicators to assess the sustainability of engineering projects and technologies, IEEE International Engineering Management Conference, 1, pp. 99-103, (2004); State of Sustainable Business Poll 2012, (2012); Silent Spring, (1962); Proceedings of the First International Conference on Concept Mapping, (2004); Dialogue on Risk Effects of Project Risk Management on Project Success, (2011)",,IGI Global,,,1522554815; 9781522554813; 9781522554820,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046585950,

However, the traditional process for assessing a farmer’s credit risk relies primarily on historical financial data. Banks’ consideration of environmental factors tends to be limited to major risks such as contaminated land liabilities, and to large project and corporate finance, as opposed to the smaller loans typical of the Australian agricultural sector. The relevant risks and dependencies for agriculture vary by sub-sector and geography, and there is a lack of standardised methodologies and evidence to support risk assessment. We provide an evidence base to support natural capital risk assessment for a single sub-sector of Australian agriculture–wheat farming. We show that such an assessment is possible, with a combination of quantitative and qualitative inputs, but the complexity and interconnectedness of natural capital processes is a challenge, particularly for soil health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Australia; Environmental Credit Risk Assessment; Environmental Risk; Natural Capital; Responsible Lending; Wheat Farming,,This work was supported by the Australian Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure and Rural Development under the Sense-T ‘Sensing Natural Capital’ project.,"Australian Farm Survey Results 201314 to 201516, (2016); Salinity and Land Management on Western Australian Farms, (2003); Year Book Australia 2009 10, (2010); Measures of Australias Progresssalinity, (2013); Characteristics of Australian Exporters 201415table 4 Value of Goods Exports by Industry of Exporter and Industry of Origin of Exported Commodity, (2016); Agricultural Commodities Australia 201415, (2016); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Impact of Weeds, (2016); Corporate Environmental Management and Credit Risk, (2010); Berger, Allen N., The economics of small business finance: The roles of private equity and debt markets in the financial growth cycle, Journal of Banking and Finance, 22, 6-8, pp. 613-673, (1998)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at,,20430795; 20430809,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050763062,

Yet there is limited research examining how to promote and facilitate private sector adaptation in developing countries and in particular how governments can create an enabling environment to stimulate and incentivize domestic private sector adaptation. In this paper, we address this gap through a review of the key factors required to provide an enabling environment for the private sector denoted by existing adaptation literatures. We do this with a focus on adaptation by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To advance this review, we draw insights from a much larger, yet generally independent, literature on enabling environments for private sector development. This literature disaggregates the private sector and highlights key constraints to the development and growth of SMEs in SSA, including deficient infrastructure and evidence of an African gap in access to and use of finance. Both areas of scholarship are then combined in a framework identifying key “building blocks” constituting enabling conditions for private sector adaptation. The framework could be applied in many ways including to focus strategies to enhance private sector adaptation and to identify trade-offs and interactions between policies or initiatives surrounding private sector development. By combining these literatures, we call for a more holistic approach to develop enabling environments for SME adaptation and climate resilient development that addresses the broader structural deficits that condition vulnerability and barriers that limit adaptive capacity.

The first concerns state regulation as against the operation of market mechanisms. The second is the tension between neoliberalism’s imaginary of freely contracting individuals as against a lived reality of submission to compulsory and collective structures. The article argues that the emergence of responsible investment, as a political strategy and as a device for regulating corporate conduct, is closely linked to the privatisation of retirement security through compulsory superannuation.

An assessment of agroforest is important for REDD+ implementation in Indonesia. In this context, evaluation of the existing agroforests and their uses is an important issue. The objectives of this research were to characterize agroforest diversity with respect to habitat, regulation, production and information functions in Kampung Birang and Kampung Merabu, Berau, East Kalimantan. This research focused on two size classes of trees, namely medium trees (10≤dbh≤20 cm) and large trees (dbh>20 cm). Local community members were trained in plot establishment (60 plots, 50×50 m), tree diameter measurement, trees tagging, and herbarium collection. Local community members identified tree species by local names and listed the species uses. Results showed that agroforests as habitat obtained diversity indices (H’) of moderate category for Kampung Birang and high category for Kampung Merabu. Otherwise, Margalef’s index (D<inf>mg)</inf> for the medium and large tree classes in Kampung Birang and Kampung Merabu were classified as high species richness category. This finding implies that enrichment planting using high economic value species is still necessary in Kampung Birang. Kampung Merabu was found to be more diverse than Kampung Birang, although soil quality in Kampung Birang was better than that in Kampung Merabu. Disturbances due to human activities that potentially impact agroforest stability were also pre-identified. The top ten tree species were classified based on importance value index (IVI) across both villages consisting of 80% shade intolerant and 20% semi-tolerant species. Agroforest showing production and information function as produces various edible fruits that are considered as key component for maintaining biodiversity sustainability and ecosystem functioning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agroforestry; Biodiversity; Ethnobotanical; Kalimantan; Redd+,,"Acknowledgements are expressed in a brief to DFC 13-08 KU (DANIDA Fellowship Center), Denmark, Directorate for Research and Innovation IPB for funding supports, the villagers of Kampung Birang and Kampung Merabu, the Nature Conservancy (TNC) Program Indonesia and Yayasan Komunitas Belajar Indonesia (YAKOBI) for facilitating the field research works.","Prosiding Seminar Hasil Litbang Hasil Hutan, (2007); Daftar Kayu Di Indonesia Yang Terpenting, (2010); Baird, Ian G., Biodiversity Conservation and Resource Tenure Regimes: A Case Study from Northeast Cambodia, Environmental Management, 32, 5, pp. 541-550, (2003); Forest Products Livelihoods and Conservation Case Studies of Non Timber Forest Product Systems, (2004); De Groot, Rudolf S., A typology for the classification, description and valuation of ecosystem functions, goods and services, Ecological Economics, 41, 3, pp. 393-408, (2002); de Jong, Wil D., Developing swidden agriculture and the threat of biodiversity loss, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 63, 2-3, pp. 187-197, (1997); Dislich, Claudia, A review of the ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations, using forests as a reference system, Biological Reviews, 92, 3, pp. 1539-1569, (2017); Drescher, Jochen, Ecological and socio-economic functions across tropical land use systems after rainforest conversion, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 371, 1694, (2016); Filqisthi, Tatag Aisyah, Carbon stock and plants biodiversity of pekarangan in Cisadane watershed West Java, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 54, 1, (2017); Daftar Berat Jenis Kelas Awet Dan Kelas Kuat Beberapa Jenis Kayu Rakyat, (2009)",,Society for Indonesian Biodiversity unsjournals@gmail.com,,1412033X; 20854722,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042056535,

Habitat equivalency analysis (HEA) was used as an evaluative approach to comparing the potential environmental damages associated with two alternatives. Application of HEA on an ex-ante basis enabled us to compare the cost effectiveness of the two alternatives considering their relative future environmental damages. Under a simple base case, environmental damages for the proposed Route G alternative were somewhat greater than for the Route N alternative. When we considered potential wide-scale ecosystem damages using a probabilistic approach, however, environmental damages for Route G were considerably greater than for Route N. When this probabilistic approach was expanded further to consider the relative scarcity of the extremely rare alkaline fen habitat that could be lost, the cost of necessary remediation increased considerably to over €11 billion.

The past decade has seen a bourgeoning interest in scaling up private investment to address persistent socioeconomic and environmental challenges globally. The recently formulated sustainable development goals and global climate agenda have further heightened the urgency for a more holistic and integrated conceptualization of transitioning towards a sustainable low-carbon economy. Despite the increasing appeal of green finance as a concept, the delivery of an empirical evidence base that illustrates the effectiveness of projects aligned with climate action and sustainable development—both in terms of measurable performance and value for money—has been less forthcoming. Concurrently, there have been numerous claims of the potential of ‘unlocking’ the trillions of dollars of private finance that is available for investment. We perform a critical analysis of literature from across a spectrum of research topics to explore the inhibiting barriers and apparent disconnect between the purported available—or required—finance and the actual finance invested in sustainable development. Furthermore, we consider actions that government agencies and the research community might consider in order to better incentivize private investment in developing and low-income countries that will facilitate low-carbon sustainable development. We provide suggestions for fiscal and policy reform in addition to identifying the need for a centralized reporting and convening body. We conclude that far more coordinated efforts are required to encourage investments in long-term and sustainable landscape-scale initiatives. Current efforts at securing finance, implementing initiatives and building the knowledge base are accelerating but remain fragmented and often sectorial in their nature; we thus offer some key recommendations for areas of future progress. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Conservation And Development; Green Finance; Low-carbon Economy; Sustainable Development Goals; Developing World; Emissions Trading; Environmental Economics; Financial System; Fiscal Policy; Future Prospect; Holistic Approach; Inhibition; Sustainable Development,developing world; emissions trading; environmental economics; financial system; fiscal policy; future prospect; holistic approach; inhibition; sustainable development,"This study is part of the CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA).

Steps include identifying and prioritising the social and environmental issues that are most pertinent to the organisation and will have the biggest impact on business, presenting the competences and skills to enable this, guidance on how to structure board meetings to ensure that these conversations truly take place, and the development of action plans and tools for measurement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Un Global Compact Accenture Ceo Study on Sustainability 2013, (2013); Reporting and Assurance, (2007); Shareholder Proposals on Social and Environmental Issues, (2014); Arnstein, Sherry R., A Ladder Of Citizen Participation, Journal of the American Planning Association, 35, 4, pp. 216-224, (1969); Ayuso, Silvia, Responsible corporate governance: Towards a stakeholder board of directors?, Corporate Ownership and Control, 6, 4 A, pp. 9-19, (2009); Business of Sustainability Imperatives Advantages and Actions, (2009); Lideranca Sustentavel Alem do Lider, (2014); Cadbury, Adrian, The Corporate Governance Agenda, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 8, 1, pp. 7-15, (2000); Casal, Christian, Building a forwardlooking board, McKinsey Quarterly, 2, (2014); Rise of Ngo Activism, (2017)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781351024891; 9781138495029,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133745064,

This behaviour challenges canonically defined fiduciary duties for investments in instances when meeting the non-financial goals correlates negatively with the return. Consequently, it calls for the reinterpretation of the fiduciary duties of mutual funds and for finding appropriate tools for managing such extended obligations. In this chapter, we aim at building a rationale for an individual investor’s extended utility function that depends on return, risk and—additionally—non-financial characteristics of the investment. We also aim at establishing a stronger link between institutional and individual investment decisions through identifying the best practices adopted by mutual funds with respect to incorporating environmental, social and governance criteria in their investment decisions. In this way we contribute to improving fiduciary duties fulfilment in the modern pooled investment sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Altman, Morris, The ethical economy and competitive markets: Reconciling altruistic, moralistic, and ethical behavior with the rational economic agent and competitive markets, Journal of Economic Psychology, 26, 5, pp. 732-757, (2005); Anand, Paul, The ethical investor: Exploring dimensions of investment behaviour, Journal of Economic Psychology, 14, 2, pp. 377-385, (1993); Journal of Political Economy, (1989); Economic Journal, (1990); Apostolakis, George N., Examining pension beneficiaries' willingness to pay for a socially responsible and impact investment portfolio: A case study in the Dutch healthcare sector, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 11, pp. 27-43, (2016); Assenza, Tiziana, Experiments on expectations in macroeconomics and finance, Research in Experimental Economics, 17, pp. 11-70, (2014); Journal of Investing, (2007); Barreda, Iván, Measuring Investors' Socially Responsible Preferences in Mutual Funds, Journal of Business Ethics, 103, 2, pp. 305-330, (2011); Bauer, Rob M.M.J., Social identification and investment decisions, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 117, pp. 121-134, (2015); Journal of Investing, (2005)",,Springer Nature,,21967075; 21967083,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130906503,

Improved environmental risk management also lowers the total cost of capital of firms, thus making them more attractive to investors. We illustrate this relationship by demonstrating how greater environmental risk may increase a firm's after-tax cost of capital. However, better environmental risk management by firms requires a range of complementary policies. The rules governing the financial system should support investment decision-making that takes into account environmental sources of risk and opportunity. Central banks can advance this objective by establishing environmental risk management and reporting requirements and adjusting capital provisioning to account for underpriced environmental threats. There is also a need to develop international guidelines and common policy and legal frameworks to support and streamline such initiatives. Developing such a policy strategy is likely to produce a self-reinforcing gain to firms, investors and society. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cost Of Capital; Environment Risk Management; Environmental Sustainability; Green Financing,,,"Aktas, Nihat, Do financial markets care about SRI?

A way to assess the financial system’s exposure to these risks and also to explore risk mitigation strategies is to incorporate sustainability risks into the framework of stress testing the financial system. This contribution emphasizes directions for the design of sustainability stress test (SST) models for the financial system. The major challenges for conceptualizing an SST framework are related to modeling the sustainability stress factors, their propagation within the financial system and the system’s response.

There are many claims about the social impact of investments in small and growing businesses, and yet these mostly focus on good news stories or a narrow set of metrics (jobs created, tax revenue, etc.). There are relatively few studies that consider the diversity of social impacts, particularly in an African context. Objectives: The aim of this research was to work collaboratively with investors in Ghana to better understand social change and contribute to their own work on improved performance and reporting. Method: Using a theory-based examination of social impacts, the research purposively selected a subset of 13 investments from the Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF) in Ghana. Theories of change were used to explore the available documentation, triangulated with insights from fund managers, entrepreneurs, senior managers and, where possible, employees. The findings were validated with VCTF staff. Results: While the research demonstrated the usefulness of a theory-based approach, it found it helpful to develop a smaller set of typologies to capture different impact pathways - a more efficient way to assess and report on social returns. In particular, the research highlights how commonly used metrics like job creation undervalue the social impact of some types of investment. Other lessons also included the value of rural businesses (not typically favoured by venture capitalists) and the potential to further extend impacts to lower income groups, but that this required real intent and leadership on the part of investors and entrepreneurs. Conclusion: We conclude that further research is merited on two fronts. Firstly, research into the scale of the small and medium enterprises and the associated investment required to support the operating costs to really manage, improve, monitor and evaluate social impact. And secondly, further field testing of different evaluation techniques to help stakeholders better understand and improve the social benefits of venture capital. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,"The research was partly funded under the DFID Accountability Grant to the Centre for Development Impact at the Institute of Developments Studies (IDS), from September to December 2016.

However, there seems to be scarcity in the current literature of empirical studies to investigate the prerequisites of a healthy risk management model for insurance organisations in developing countries. This paper is an attempt to develop a risk management model for insurance organisations operating in the context of the developing country of Palestine. An exploratory qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, archival documents and observations were adopted in this research inquiry. Data were analysed using thematic analysis approach. Although data analysis show that Palestinian insurance organisations' managerial practices are relatively in regulatory compliance with risk management practices, the results highlight the necessity of providing a supportive organisational culture and capacity building functions to provide highly qualified insurance professionals as a corner stone for insurance companies' competitiveness in developing countries. The developed managerial model is important as it identifies the determinants of a successful enterprise risk management realisation that will help the insurance companies in developing countries context to improve their strengths and maintain a sustainable growth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Developing Countries; Enterprise Risk Management; Insurance Sector; Model Development; Palestine; Qualitative Study; Risk Management,,,"Ahsan, Dewan Ali, Farmers' motivations, risk perceptions and risk management strategies in a developing economy: Bangladesh experience, Journal of Risk Research, 14, 3, pp. 325-349, (2011); Alhawari, Samer, Knowledge-Based Risk Management framework for Information Technology project, International Journal of Information Management, 32, 1, pp. 50-65, (2012); Microinsurance, (2012); Attride-Stirling, Jennifer, Thematic networks: An analytic tool for qualitative research, Qualitative Research, 1, 3, pp. 385-405, (2001); Plant Hazard Analysis and Safety Instrumentation Systems, (2017); RT A, (2010); Björklund, Christina, Work motivation and perceived risks, International Journal of Risk Assessment and Management, 7, 2, pp. 237-247, (2007); undefined; Cheng, T.

What is the motivation? This study aims to find the motives for considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in bank lending process. A primary survey has been conducted to know the current status and motivation for incorporating ESG factors in investment decisions. Sample comprised 30 private commercial banks (PCBs) operating in Bangladesh. Data collected were analyzed with graphs, descriptive statistics, and regression analysis. Findings of the study indicate that banks are mostly considering basic environmental, social and governance factors set by regulators qualitatively. They are lagging behind in considering the advanced ESG criteria needed for sustainable and efficient credit risk management. Based on motivation for incorporating ESG factors, it was found that banks pioneering in incorporating ESG factors in lending decisions are compensated through better financial performance. Findings of the study are expected to encourage practitioners and policy-makers to take more pragmatic steps to incorporate ESG risk factors quantitatively in lending decision-making process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bangladesh; Esg Risk; Financial Performance; Private Commercial Banks,,,"Aichi Gakuin University Review Papers, (2012); Ahmed, Sarwar Uddin, Institutional investment and corporate social performance: Linkage towards sustainable development, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 21, 1, pp. 1-13, (2014); International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, (2014); Corporate Social Performance Index, (2011); Mainstreaming Corporate Social Responsibility Csr in Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh, (2008); Environmental Risk Management Erm Guideline for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh, (2011); Policy Guidelines for Green Banking, (2011); Baron, David P., Managerial contracting and corporate social responsibility, Journal of Public Economics, 92, 1-2, pp. 268-288, (2008); Journal of Asset Management, (2004); Bénabou, Roland, Individual and corporate social responsibility, Economica, 77, 305, pp. 1-19, (2010)",,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,,18167403; 19917074,,,,English,Review,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051484932,

Moreover, it can promote environmentally sustainable investments and encourage businesses to adopt similar practices. Because Islam encourages preservation and prohibits harm to the earth, Islamic banks are expected to follow such practices in pursuit of Sharīah compliance. In Malaysia, Islamic banks have already embarked on this path, mainly by practising conservation in operational matters; however, other areas of sustainable financing have been less enthusiastically pursued. This study recommends a three-level approach: (1) at the banking level, more proactive steps should be taken, e.g. greening operations, introducing environmentally friendly products and services, complying with environmental regulations, creating awareness and training stakeholders; (2) at the national level, the Central Bank should introduce appropriate policies and guidelines; and (3) at an international level, voluntary principles should be adopted to ensure compliance with global initiatives. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environment; Green Banking; Islamic Banking In Malaysia; Sustainability,,"* Acknowledgements: The authors would like to thank the Research Grant Office and the Law Faculty, University Malaya, for providing the funding to complete this research, and their research assistants, Nuraida Mohd Noor and Nur Faizira Abdul Rahman, for their assistance.","Rasiah, Rajah A/l, Climate change mitigation: comparative assessment of Malaysian and ASEAN scenarios, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24, 3, pp. 2632-2642, (2017); Global Risks Report 2016, (2016); Channel News Asia, (2015); Concept Paper on Green Banking Concept Paper Infrastructure Housing and SME Finance Department State Bank of Pakistan, (2015); Malaysia Banker S Journal, (2013); Governor S Keynote Address in Global Islamic Finance Forum 5 0, (2016); Environmental Performance Index 2016 Malaysia S Performance in Environmental Performance Index, (2016); Green Finance Key Business Considerations for Financing A Sustainable and Low Carbon Economy, (2016); International Journal of Economics Finance and Management Sciences, (2015); International Journal of Research in Business Management, (2014)",,Brill Academic Publishers,,02680556; 15730255,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045561067,

Like the rest of the world, India’s hydrocarbon demand in the mobility domain continues to rise and is a major cause for concern given the implications concerning greenhouse gas emissions. Assuming the country’s energy demand maintains its present trajectory, it is predicted, that by 2030 India will have to import about 94% of its crude oil consumption. The Indian government introduced the National Mission on Biodiesel in 2003 and subsequently promulgated the National Policy on Biofuels in 2009. The policy proposes an indicative target of 20% blending of biofuels—both bio-diesel and bio-ethanol, by 2017. The availability of feedstock crops, the presence of a large sugar industry and favourable climatic conditions for plants like Jatropha carcus is conducive for producing bio-fuels in the country. Despite these policy initiatives, in 2017 it was clear that the bio-diesel is yet to become a popular alternative fuel in the mobility sector in India. The present paper deploys the strategic niche management framework to understand the policy attempts and observed lag in this experiment of bio-diesel mission. Within the framework of transitions literature, the study aims at presenting the findings from the process tracing study of the Indian experimentation on bio-diesel since inception. It investigates as to what extent the experiment has been embedded in the incumbent mobility regime. This study can offer an insight into the uniqueness of challenges in up-scaling any experiment that aims at transforming the hydrocarbon dominated mobility sector in India. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biodiesel; Blending; Economics; Energy Policy; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Hydrocarbons; Sugar Industry; Climatic Conditions; Hydrocarbon Demand; Indian Government; Indicative Targets; National Policies; Policy Initiatives; Strategic Niche Management; Transportation Fuels; Diesel Engines,Biodiesel; Blending; Economics; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Sugar industry; Climatic conditions; Hydrocarbon demand; Indian government; Indicative targets; National policies; Policy initiatives; Strategic niche management; Transportation fuels; Diesel engines,"Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the Dutch Research Foundation (WOTRO-NWO) which had funded the integrated programme on “Experimenting for Sustainability in India and Thailand: a transitions perspective on sustainable electricity and mobility initiative.” This article is a part of the WOTRO-NWO funded research programme at Global Change Programme of Jadavpur Unversity.

They are incorporating these assessments in their day-to-day management and long-term investment decisions. Already, there are efforts to develop international guidelines, common policies and legal frameworks for such assessments, as well as the desire to foster climate financing. We examine recent progress in East Asia and the rest of the world in setting targets, pricing policies, and other mechanisms to reduce climate risks. We develop a model that demonstrates how reduced climate risk management may lower the total cost of capital of firms, thus making them more attractive to investors. We discuss the additional policies needed to support improved climate risk management in investment decisions, private investments in climate science, technology and innovation (STI) expansion, and more widespread adoption of climate financing and principles. Central banks, financial authorities, and governments can advance this objective by creating financial incentives to support investment decision-making. This would take into account factors such as improving climate performance, establishing better climate risk management and reporting requirements to foster green STI, and developing international guidelines and common policy and legal frameworks to support better climate risk management, assessments and reporting. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Finance; Climate Risk; Corporate Initiatives; East Asia; Green Science; Technology And Innovation (sti); Climate Change; Decision Making; Environmental Economics; Environmental Policy; Environmental Risk; Innovation; Investment Incentive; Quantitative Analysis; Technology; Far East,climate change; decision making; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental risk; innovation; investment incentive; quantitative analysis; technology; Far East,"Acknowledgments: This research was funded by the 2017 STEPI Fellowship, Science and Technology Policy Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea, awarded to Edward B.

However, there has thus far been surprisingly little exploration of the evolving normative implications of environmentalism: existing organizational research treats environmentalism as a static, uniform and quasi-naturalistic phenomenon. In this article, we argue instead that environmentalism is fluid and multifaceted, evolving over time to produce differing conceptualizations that become affiliated with – and mobilized by – particular groups of actors. Using the theoretical framing of path generation, we identify how environmentalism follows a path characterized by episodes of re-conceptualization and re-labelling, a discursive evolution reflecting incremental yet consequential interactions with other institutional paths. We engage in a conceptual history to identify junctures where environmentalism meets with other institutional trajectories, facilitating shifts in meaning. We identify moments of crookedness in the transnational environmental path that are symbolically reflected in label changes – from the emergence of “sustainable development” in the 1980s, to “sustainability” in the 1990s, and more recently, an offshoot towards “resilience”. Those label changes are not only, we propose, symbolic markers but are also performative and entrench consequential regime transformations with regard to environmentalism. Through our exploration, we contribute to theory development while also generating empirical implications: theory-wise, we identify mechanisms of path generation that inform broader debates around path dependence. Empirically, we illustrate how different variants of environmentalism are connected to specific meaning systems, exhibiting affinity with different organizational fields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Conceptual History; Environmentalism; Path Generation; Resilience; Sustainability,,,"Positivism Presuppositions and Current Controversies, (1982); Antikainen, Ari, The capitalist state and education: The case of restructuring the nordic model, Current Sociology, 58, 4, pp. 530-550, (2010); Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy, (1994); Banerjee, Subhabrata Bobby, Who sustains whose development?

The objectives of this paper are to conduct a systematic review to examine the policies, practices, and research efforts in the area of sustainable construction project financing, and to explore the potential opportunities for the future research. To achieve these goals, this paper first reviewed the sustainable construction project financing practices implemented by four representative developed economies including the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, and Australia. Then, this paper reviewed the efforts and initiatives launched by three international organizations including the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and International Finance Corporation. After that, this paper reviewed the research efforts of sustainable construction project financing published in peer-review journals and books. This paper identified four major research themes within this area, which are the review of financial stakeholders and market of sustainable construction, benefits and barriers to sustainable construction project financing, financial vehicles for sustainable construction projects, innovative models and mechanisms for sustainable construction project financing. Additionally, this paper revealed five directions for the future research of sustainable construction project financing, which are the identification of financial issues in sustainable construction projects, the investigation of financial vehicles for sustainable construction projects in terms of their strengths, limitations, and performances, the examination of critical drivers for implementing sustainable construction project financing, the development of a knowledge-based decision support system for implementing sustainable construction financing, and the development of best practices for implementing sustainable construction project financing. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by reviewing existing policies, practices, and research efforts in the area of sustainable construction project financing.

This provides the context to explore low-carbon development (LCD) pathways for the West African electricity system. Methods: The study relied on both primary and secondary sources to elicit required information. These data were elicited from relevant authorities in the West African electricity system, namely, West African Power Pool and ECOWAS Regional Electricity Regulatory Authority. The objectives were to evaluate the planning processes in the West African Power Pool electricity system vis-a-vis low-carbon development strategy (LCDS), develop a System dynamics (SD) model, and assess the relevance of the developed model to examine the nonlinear relationship between generation adequacy and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction. The SD model examined the tension between providing adequate supply capacity against reducing emission from the generation technologies in the West Africa electricity system. This model arranged the complexities in the system and established the basic interconnecting structure to conduct the analysis. High leverage points were identified. Results: Four high leverage points were identified: capacity factor (CF), emission factor (EF), time to adjust capacity, and expectation formation. CF and EF improvement increased efficiency in the system. The expectation formation periods were determined at 7.5 years for the base case scenario and 7 years for the low-carbon development option scenario. Time to adjust capacity was located at 21 and 20 years respectively; deduced from the average time, it will take to construct a combined cycle gas power plant (3 years) and an allowance of 2 years for delays and its decommissioning time. Between 2011 and 2012, in LCD option scenario, emission of GHG to the atmosphere dropped as generation did but began a steady rise for the simulation period to a value of 6.154 billion tCO<inf>2</inf> in 2060. Conclusions: Electricity Planning-Low-Carbon Development (EP-LCD) model—with three modules, was developed for assessing WAPP in low carbon economy. High leverage points identified in the model simulation situate three policy options for overcoming poverty and mitigation targets as regards resource mix, investment cost recovery, and technical factors to reduce system’s environmental footprint. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Electricity System; Feedback Loop; Leverage Points; Low Carbon Development; Wapp; Climate Change; Depreciation; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Greenhouse Gases; Planning; Renewable Energy Resources; Strategic Planning; System Theory; Electricity System; Feed-back Loop; Leverage Points; Low-carbon Development; Wapp; Electric Power System Planning; Climate Change; Decommissioning; Economic Growth; Electricity Industry; Emission; Energy Planning; Greenhouse Gas; Investment; Power Plant; West Africa,Climate change; Depreciation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Strategic planning; System theory; Electricity system; Feed-back loop; Leverage points; Low-carbon development; WAPP; Electric power system planning; climate change; decommissioning; economic growth; electricity industry; emission; energy planning; greenhouse gas; investment; power plant; West Africa,"This research is supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme.

Companies therefore need to prepare for the consequences which the proposed tax will have on their operations. At present, the landscape is overburdened by a large quantity of information intended to support the carbon tax, yet specific guidance is limited. This creates uncertainty for stakeholders. In this paper, five key areas of uncertainty are identified for further investigation. Since the 12L tax incentive can be regarded as the mirror image of carbon tax, it provides a structured approach to determine how similar issues are resolved. The comparison highlights the benefit of a well-defined regulatory structure which allows applicants to consult relevant references in order to resolve specific problems. This paper endeavours to construct a similar structure by reviewing several references associated with the carbon tax landscape. Relevant references are identified, grouped and prioritised to provide a focussed structure for guidance towards addressing uncertainty in the carbon tax landscape. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",12l Tax Incentive; Carbon Tax; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gas (ghg); Reference Landscape; Regulatory Structure; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gases; Carbon Taxes; Greenhouse Gas (ghg); Reference Landscape; Regulatory Structure; Tax Incentive; Taxation,Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Carbon taxes; Greenhouse gas (GHG); reference landscape; Regulatory structure; Tax incentive; Taxation,"This work was sponsored by HVAC International (Pty) Ltd.

Projects play a pivotal role in the realization of more sustainable business practices and the concept of sustainability has also been linked to project management. However, how managers of projects consider sustainability in their operational daily work is still to be explored. This paper uses Q-methodology to investigate the consideration of sustainability aspects in the decision making processes of project managers. The research question was How are dimensions of sustainability considered in the decision-making processes of project managers in relation to the triple constraint of time, cost and quality? Based on the Q-sort of selected respondents, the study found that the consideration of sustainability principles is underrepresented, compared to the triple constraint criteria. However, the analysis of the individual Q-sorts revealed four distinct perspectives that differ significantly in their consideration of sustainability principles and triple constraint criteria. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Decision-making; Project; Project Management; Sustainability; Triple Constraint; Managers; Project Management; Sustainable Development; Decision Making Process; Management Decision-making; Project; Project Managers; Research Questions; Sustainability Principles; Sustainable Business; Triple Constraint; Decision Making; Business; Conceptual Framework; Decision Making; Project Management; Research Method; Sustainability,Managers; Project management; Sustainable development; Decision making process; Management decision-making; Project; Project managers; Research questions; Sustainability principles; Sustainable business; Triple constraint; Decision making; business; conceptual framework; decision making; project management; research method; sustainability,,"Aaltonen, Kirsi, A project lifecycle perspective on stakeholder influence strategies in global projects, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 26, 4, pp. 381-397, (2010); Adams, Carol A., Integrating sustainability reporting into management practices, Accounting Forum, 32, 4, pp. 288-302, (2008); Agarwal, Nitin, Defining 'success' for software projects: An exploratory revelation, International Journal of Project Management, 24, 4, pp. 358-370, (2006); Andersen, Mikael Skou, Governance by green taxes: implementing clean water policies in Europe 1970–1990, Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, 2, 1, pp. 39-63, (1999); Apm Supports Sustainability Outlooks, (2006); Atkinson, Roger, Project management: Cost, time and quality, two best guesses and a phenomenon, its time to accept other success criteria, International Journal of Project Management, 17, 6, pp. 337-342, (1999); de Bakker, Karel F.C., Does risk management contribute to IT project success?

Changes to business models are recognized as a fundamental approach to realize innovations for sustainability. However, little is known about the successful adoption of sustainable business models (SBMs). The purpose of this paper is to develop a unified theoretical perspective for understanding business model innovations that lead to better organizational economic, environmental and social performance. The paper examines bodies of literature on business model innovation, sustainability innovation, networks theory, stakeholder theory and product–service systems. We develop five propositions that support the creation of SBMs in a unified perspective, which lays a foundation to support organizations in investigating and experimenting with alternative new business models. This article contributes to the emerging field of SBMs, which embed economic, environmental and social flows of value that are created, delivered and captured in a value network. It highlights gaps for addressing the challenges of business model innovation for sustainability and suggests avenues for future research. © 2017 The Authors.

Forest management mechanisms at an inter-institutional level in Japan have been identified to hinder the implementation of forest management that is focused on the equal production of ecosystem services. This study presents an institutional analysis of unsustainability risk causality in a private industrial forest in Kochi Prefecture, Japan, from an ecosystem perspective incorporating common ecosystem service hazards that affect the sustainability functions of forests. This was performed with the aim to offer a basis for a less complicated analysis of ecosystem service hazards in industrial forests and to provide causal clarity at different institution levels. It was found that due to Japan's systematic top-down forest management approach with the law at the top, vertical relationships cause direct and indirect negative horizontal relationships at each institutional level. To mitigate vertical and horizontal effects, institutional adaptions must be performed to address a combination of satisfier and hygiene factors. Under current conditions of non-enforceable forest policy, objectives and decisions regarding policy and management instruments at the national level must be integrated. This requires effective and adaptive multi-level institutional governance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ecosystem Services; Institutional Analysis; Small Scale Forestry; Japan; Kochi Prefecture; Private Forest Owner; Sfm; Sustainability; Ecology; Forestry; Hazards; Risk Assessment; Societies And Institutions; Sustainable Development; Ecosystem Services; Japan; Kochi Prefecture; Private Forest Owners; Small-scale Forestry; Ecosystems; Ecosystem Service; Environmental Economics; Forest Management; Forestry; Forestry Policy; Governance Approach; Private Land; Risk Assessment; Stand Structure; Sustainability; Sustainable Forestry; Forests; Risk Assessment; Kochi [shikoku]; Shikoku,Ecology; Forestry; Hazards; Risk assessment; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Ecosystem services; Japan; Kochi Prefecture; Private forest owners; Small-scale forestry; Ecosystems; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forest management; forestry; forestry policy; governance approach; private land; risk assessment; stand structure; sustainability; sustainable forestry; Forests; Risk Assessment; Kochi [Shikoku]; Shikoku,,"State of the World S Forests, (2012); Business Strategy and the Environment, (2003); Chen, Juan, The implications of new forest tenure reforms and forestry property markets for sustainable forest management and forest certification in China, Journal of Environmental Management, 129, pp. 206-215, (2013); Day, J.

By adopting a network approach to financial dependencies, we look at how climate policy risk might propagate through the financial system. We develop a network-based climate stress-test methodology and apply it to large Euro Area banks in a 'green' and a 'brown' scenario. We find that direct and indirect exposures to climate-policy-relevant sectors represent a large portion of investors' equity portfolios, especially for investment and pension funds. Additionally, the portion of banks' loan portfolios exposed to these sectors is comparable to banks' capital. Our results suggest that climate policy timing matters. An early and stable policy framework would allow for smooth asset value adjustments and lead to potential net winners and losers.

Given the diversity of ecological, political, and socio-economic systems where offsets may be applied, place-based information is likely to be most useful in designing and implementing offset programs, along with guiding principles that assure best practice. We reviewed the research on biodiversity offsets to explore gaps and needs. While the peer-reviewed literature on offsets is growing rapidly, it is heavily dominated by ecological theory, wetland ecosystems, and U.S.-based research. Given that majority of offset policies and programs are occurring in middle- and low-income countries, the research gaps we identified present a number of risks. They also present an opportunity to create regionally based learning platforms focused on pilot projects and institutional capacity building.

The aims of this study are: (1) to describe the concepts of corporate social responsibility and Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI), focusing on the relationship between them, (2) to introduce the main CSR risks and opportunities of OFDI, and (3) to summarize the possible solutions for addressing CSR-related risks in OFDI activities. Our study indicates that zero tolerance of corruption is a strategic objective of investing companies.

For adaptation in particular, it remains unclear what mobilised private finance is. Research so far has focused on its potential and experiences in developing countries, but not on the arguments of those who introduced and continue to advocate private adaptation finance: developed countries. This paper investigates the positions of developed countries and development banks and agencies. In particular, it aims to identify whether those actors can reach a common understanding of private adaptation finance that minimises norm conflicts in a fragmented climate finance system. Empirically, the paper examines the Biennial Reports and submissions on Strategies and Approaches for Mobilising Scaled-up Finance of six developed country parties, as well as data from interviews with experts from development banks and agencies. The analysis finds a number of discrepancies between these sets of actors, for example on motivations for and modes of private sector involvement. This discrepancy is the result of ambiguity around the concept of private adaptation finance in a highly fragmented climate finance architecture. This ambiguity is problematic when the aim of mobilising private adaptation finance is to contribute to the $100 billion commitment. However, if the aim is adaptation in practice, both ambiguity and fragmentation might actually make the climate finance system more inclusive and innovative. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Climate Finance; Climate Policy; Fragmentation; Private Finance; Adaptive Management; Developing World; Empirical Analysis; Environmental Policy; Global Perspective; Habitat Fragmentation; Private Sector; Questionnaire Survey; United Nations,adaptive management; developing world; empirical analysis; environmental policy; global perspective; habitat fragmentation; private sector; questionnaire survey; United Nations,"Finally, in contrast to the analysed developed countries, most respondents emphasise that technical assistance is crucial in projects, and one respondent mentions green bonds. Technical assistance, both for financial institutions and for those who implement adaptation projects, can be financed through grants. Bonds are mentioned in the context of cities with comprehensive adaptation strategies. If related adaptation measures have a return on investment, or if a city plans to finance them publicly anyway, bonds could frontload investments.","Abadie, Luis María, An analysis of the causes of the mitigation bias in international climate finance, Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 18, 7, pp. 943-955, (2013); Will Private Finance Support Climate Change Adaptation in Developing Countries, (2011); Accounting for Private Contributions Towards International Pledges, (2015); Ayers, Jessica M., Resolving the adaptation paradox: Exploring the potential for deliberative adaptation policy-making in Bangladesh, Global Environmental Politics, 11, 1, pp. 62-88, (2011); Best, Jacqueline, Ambiguity and Uncertainty in International Organizations: A History of Debating IMF Conditionality, International Studies Quarterly, 56, 4, pp. 674-688, (2012); Best, Jacqueline, Bureaucratic ambiguity, Economy and Society, 41, 1, pp. 84-106, (2012); Biermann, Frank H.B., The fragmentation of global governance architectures: A framework for analysis, Global Environmental Politics, 9, 4, pp. 14-40, (2009); Improving the Effectiveness of Climate Finance A Survey of Leveraging Methodologies, (2011); Estimating Mobilized Private Finance for Adaptation, (2015); Brunner, Steffen, Climate finance: A transaction cost perspective on the structure of state-to-state transfers, Global Environmental Change, 27, 1, pp. 138-143, (2014)",,Springer Netherlands,,15679764; 15731553,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008147373,

SRI provides an opportunity to express and promote ethical values via choice of financial instruments. While policy-makers have tried to encourage greater participation in SRI, the majority of retail investors retain a conventional approach to investment. I develop a conceptual framework to improve the effectiveness of SRI policy-making. The first part of the framework comprises a transmission mechanism which emphasizes the role of SRI as a driver for sustainable development. The second part is a model of the individual decision for or against SRI. The framework suggests that low SRI demand is a case of behavioral market failure, and that nudging is a suitable tool for dismantling behavioral barriers to SRI. A specific example of smart choice architecture is used to illustrate the framework’s potential in the design of an SRI nudge. Assuming the nudge stands up to the rigors of empirical testing, it may well provide a feasible alternative for policy-makers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Choice Architecture; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Policy-making; Ethics; Investor Behavior; Nudge Theory; Sustainable And Responsible Investment; Sustainable Development,,,"Action Control from Cognition to Behavior, (1985); American Economic Review, (1991); Anand, Paul, The ethical investor: Exploring dimensions of investment behaviour, Journal of Economic Psychology, 14, 2, pp. 377-385, (1993); Ashraf, Nava, Adam Smith, behavioral economist, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 19, 3, pp. 131-145, (2005); Behaviorally Informed Financial Services Regulation, (2008); Bénabou, Roland, Individual and corporate social responsibility, Economica, 77, 305, pp. 1-19, (2010); Our Common Future, (1987); Camerer, Colin F., Behavioral economics: Reunifying psychology and economics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 96, 19, pp. 10575-10577, (1999); Carroll, Archie B., The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders, Business Horizons, 34, 4, pp. 39-48, (1991); Journal of Business Ethics, (2013)",,Springer Netherlands,,01674544; 15730697,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944625940,

This paper contributes new empirical data from 58 in-depth interviews and a global investor survey to explore how climate change is being learnt socially and asocially within the institutional investment industry. This research seeks to identify ways in which the relatively novel concept of ‘stranded assets’ can be better disseminated to investment professionals. Importantly, both social and asocial learning can affect investment decisions, with some actors usefully providing information via both channels. Better learning, language and leadership within the institutional investment system could facilitate the dissemination of climate and stranded asset discourses among investors, but an imperative to communicate effectively rather than simply communicating more is noted.

Due to a number of factors, such as increased consumer awareness on the importance of eco-products, new statutory and legal regulations, and increased competition, retail chains are increasingly oriented to the concept of sustainable development, in particular promoting its environmental component, ecoproducts, and eco packaging. Trade, especially retail, plays an important role in linking producers and consumers, and society as a whole. In this way, trade has a good overview of all the changes occurring in the environment, production, and consumer needs. Changes in the environment further stimulate trade to operate in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, including all its dimensions. In this regard, special attention is paid to the protection of working and living environment, as components of sustainable development. The chapter includes a review of literature in the field of sustainable development and application of this concept in the trade and retail sector. The theoretical aspect of the research focuses on conceptualization of sustainable development and its environmental component in trade and retail. With reference to theoretical research on the implementation of environmental component of sustainable development in trade, empirical research has been conducted from two aspects. First, analysis focuses on the performance and socioeconomic importance of trade sector of the Republic of Serbia, as well as the number of ISO 14001 certificates in trading companies. Second, analysis shifts to the largest trading companies in the Republic of Serbia, based on available secondary data on the implementation of the concept of sustainable development and its environmental component. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Component; Republic Of Serbia; Retail; Sustainable Development; Trade,,,"undefined, (2015); undefined, (2015); Burger, Paul, Towards a capability approach of sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, 19, 8, pp. 787-795, (2011); undefined, (2016); Annual Activity and Sustainability Report, (2014); undefined, (2015); Costanza, Robert, Defining and predicting sustainability, Ecological Economics, 15, 3, pp. 193-196, (1995); undefined, (2015); Inovacije U Trgovinskom Menadzmentu Eng Innovations in Trade Management, (2010); International Business and Management, (2013)",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,,,9781787145009; 9781787144996,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148201640,

For too long, real estate companies only felt obliged to generate profits. An awareness of the finite nature of natural resources, progressive climate change, as well as social injustice, and spectacular business failures, have all increased awareness of the need for a clear sustainability agenda at all levels of the sector. This increasing pressure from society and tighter regulatory framework have placed the real estate industry’s contribution to sustainable development at the forefront of discussions. The industry share amounts to 30–40 percent of all resource utilization and GHG emissions, which emphasizes that the real estate sector is in the limelight of political debate on tackling climate change. Sustainable real estate development covers all aspects of mitigation. Reducing GHG emission can be achieved, for example, with recycled building materials, higher density and energetic retrofitting. Property certification and a clear focus on life-cycle-costing (LCC) are key elements. Furthermore, adaption of the property stock becomes more and more relevant, as climate change and extreme weather events become more frequent over time.

This money - our money - represents an enormous share of economic and capital market wealth. It has seeded and grown innumerable innovative industries that have had far-reaching impacts. However, the 2008 financial crisis has seriously threatened these trusted assets and drained away prosperity.In response, a growing number of investors are moving towards responsible investment policies and strategies, addressing the rising expectations of consumers and benefiting from the financial advantages such strategies bring. Everyday citizens now want to see their investments not only do well, but do good. But, what constitutes responsible investment, and how can it be undertaken in practice? What is the impact of responsible investment strategies on investment performance? How can trustees, managers and advisors implement these strategies in line with their fiduciary responsibilities? How can plan trustees and staff members convince all stakeholders of the need to invest in resilient growth?The Responsible Investor Handbook, commissioned by the AFL-CIO and global progressive investors, is a lay-friendly “how-to” manual, sharing the best in responsible investment practice with capital stewards and other policy leaders who want to do the right thing with our common wealth.This invaluable toolkit enables readers to: Understand the pioneering role of workers’ capital in building infrastructure and vital services Devise a responsible investment strategy Select and monitor service providers Bring on board stakeholders with conflicting interests Avoid short-termism The Responsible Investor Handbook is the first book devoted to aligning the long-term investment priorities of working people with capital stewards and the financial complex that manages their assets. It is an essential read for trustees and capital stewards seeking the positive outcomes of a responsible investment strategy; pension and institutional investors looking to realign their strategies with the interests of workers and citizens; and any professional seeking a better understanding of the importance of responsible investment and its impact on capital markets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"OECD Working Papers on Insurance and Private Pensions, (2009); Wall Street Journal, (2015); New York Times, (2014); U S News World Report, (2013); Calpers Economic Impacts in California, (2014); Calpers Eliminates Hedge Fund Program in Effort to Reduce Complexity and Costs in Investment Portfolio, (2014); From Sri to Esg the Changing World of Responsible Investing, (2013); Canadian Responsible Investment Mutual Funds, (2015); Cbs News, (2015); From the Stockholder to the Stakeholder how Sustainability can Drive Financial Outperformance, (2015)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781351283632; 9781783535552,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086196306,

Business-school faculty members often seem to place greater weight on winning the approval of peers in their academic discipline than on gaining the approval of their business-school colleagues. Many business schools saw their founding mission as the professionalisation of the management of business, in much the same way as medical schools have institutionalised medicine.

Pension investment issues differ between defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and hybrid plans, which combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution plans occurring in many countries generally places responsibility on individual participants for making investment decisions. Pension investing is different from other types of investing. While it is affected by investment principles applicable to investing generally, pension investing differs from non-pension investing due to tax considerations, the life-cycle nature of pension investments, and behavioral factors that sometimes cause pension participants to invest differently from investment professionals. This paper analyzes asset allocation strategies used by pension participants for investing defined contribution pension assets. We discuss both economic theories that predict what rational pension investors would do (normative theories) and theories that attempt to explain why individual pension participants hold the portfolios that they actually hold (positive theories). It divides the strategies into traditional strategies and strategies related to behavioral economics. While many of the strategies have been developed by academics, some of them are suboptimal strategies used by unsophisticated participants. When data are available to permit it, an assessment is made of the extent to which a strategy is used. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Paper Presented at the American Economic Association Meetings, (2015); Entrepreneur, (2007); Halal Investing, (2014); How do Household Portfolio Shares Vary with Age, (2025); Asset Management A Systematic Approach to Factor Investing, (2014); Rotman International Journal of Pension Management, (2014); 2014 Universe Benchmarks Measuring Employee Savings and Investing Behavior in Defined Contribution Plans, (2014); Journal of Retirement, (2013); International Diversification Works Eventually, (2010); Bagliano, Fabio Cesare, Optimal life-cycle portfolios for heterogeneous workers, Review of Finance, 18, 6, pp. 2283-2323, (2014)",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,9781536124620; 9781536124675,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034816776,

Though a change in the national policy towards more sustainable energy sources is desirable, wind energy is not free from negative impacts. According to studies done in the temperate region, bats are negatively affected by wind farms, due to fatalities resulting from direct collision with the turbines or from barotrauma. If in many countries national and international laws follow guidelines for consideration of potential impacts of wind farms on bats, and even consider potential minimization and mitigation schemes, the Brazilian current normative for wind farm licencing presents vague approaches on this matter. With a few exceptions, states are the main responsible for the licencing processes. In this context, a joint initiative in Rio Grande do Sul, the state with the third highest wind power generation in Brazil, put together the Secretary of State for the Environment and Sustainable Development of Rio Grande do Sul, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and the Brazilian Society for the Study of Bats to set reference terms for consideration of bats in impact assessments of wind farms in the state. Consensus was built from a collaborative process resulting from a two-day workshop involving technicians and academics with expertise in bat biology, conservation and management. Guidelines were divided into pre-installation, construction, and operation phases, considering the decisions to make, potential impacts and relevant questions to answer, methodological and technical recommendations or constraints, and current gaps in knowledge. Here we describe this collaborative experience hoping it can be replicable in other Brazilian states and used by other potentially impacting sectors. With few adaptations and considering specificities in the regional bat fauna and environmental conditions, the proposed reference terms can be used elsewhere in Brazil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Chiroptera; Environmental Licensing; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development; Wind Energy,,,"Artigo Para A Camara Brasil Alemanha Para Publicacao Na Rio 20, (2012); Boletim De Dados Fevereiro 2016, (2016); Sustainable Energy for Developing Countries Sapiens, (2009); Amorim, Francisco, Factors influencing bat activity and mortality at a wind farm in the mediterranean region, Acta Chiropterologica, 14, 2, pp. 439-457, (2012); undefined; Relationships Between Bats and Wind Turbines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia an Assessment of Fatality Search Protocols Patterns of Fatality and Behavioral Interactions with Wind Turbines, (2005); Arnett, Edward B., A preliminary evaluation on the use of dogs to recover bat fatalities at wind energy facilities, Wildlife Society Bulletin, 34, 5, pp. 1440-1445, (2006); Arnett, Edward B., Impacts of wind energy development on bats: Implications for conservation, pp. 435-456, (2013); Arnett, Edward B., Patterns of bat fatalities at wind energy facilities in North America, Journal of Wildlife Management, 72, 1, pp. 61-78, (2008); Arnett, Edward B., Altering turbine speed reduces bat mortality at wind-energy facilities, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 9, 4, pp. 209-214, (2011)",,Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) oecologia@biologia.ufrj.br,,21776199,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034037905,

These kind of investments aim towards ""sustainable"" development both environmentally (safeguarding the shortage of resources such as land, energy, and natural elements), and socially (protecting the population and raising its level of well-being) according to so-called ""ethical finance"", instead of a mere ""speculative"" investment. Effectively, real estate is still an investment sector only marginally explored by the socially-responsible funds. Based on these premises, this paper will: (i) briefly analyze the nature of socially-responsible investments, setting their characteristics apart from ""traditional investments"" and (ii) propose a possible procedure (of the multi-criteria type) which aims to assess socially-responsible investments in real estate.

Despite the variety of available environmental sustainability indicators, the absence of a commonly accepted categorization framework often creates confusion and inhibits indicator deployment in practice. This paper addresses this issue with a bottom-up approach that categorizes environmental sustainability indicators using their text-based objective information, and investigates industrial perceptions on indicator use. As the foundation for this work, 55 environmental sustainability indicators were extracted from extant literature. Then, companies from manufacturing and service domain were surveyed to reveal perceptions on utilization status (i.e. used in practice and future implementation) and utility (i.e. usefulness and practicality) of each indicator. For indicator categorization, the text descriptions of the collected indicators were modeled using a text mining technique, the correlated topic model, to extract their latent topics as a basis to categorize the indicators. As a result, five categories and their relevant indicators were defined. Further, the utilization status and utility levels of the indicators within the derived categories were analyzed. Possible relationships between indicator utility levels and company characteristics were also identified through logistic regression. Utility levels of specific indicators were found to change subject to market location and industry sector. Findings from this study can complement top-down conceptual categorization and inform implementation of indicators. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Categorization; Environmental Sustainability Indicators; Indicator Utility; Indicator Utilization; Text Mining; Environmental Impact; Environmental Protection; Manufacture; Sustainable Development; Bottom Up Approach; Categorization; Environmental Sustainability; Logistic Regressions; Objective Information; Text Mining; Text Mining Techniques; User Perspectives; Data Mining; Bottom-up Approach; Data Mining; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Indicator; Global Perspective; Manufacturing; Market System; Perception; Sustainability; Top-down Approach; Utility Sector,Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Bottom up approach; Categorization; Environmental sustainability; Logistic regressions; Objective information; Text mining; Text mining techniques; User perspectives; Data mining; bottom-up approach; data mining; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; global perspective; manufacturing; market system; perception; sustainability; top-down approach; utility sector,,"Airoldi, Edoardo M., Combining stochastic block models and mixed membership for statistical network analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4503 LNCS, pp. 57-74, (2007); Albino, Vito, Input-output models for the analysis of a local/global supply chain, International Journal of Production Economics, 78, 2, pp. 119-131, (2002); Albino, Vito, Environmental strategies and green product development: An overview on sustainability-driven companies, Business Strategy and the Environment, 18, 2, pp. 83-96, (2009); Albino, Vito, Do inter-organizational collaborations enhance a firm's environmental performance?

To establish causality, I employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) technique, using brokerage closures and mergers as exogenous shocks to analyst coverage, as well as an instrumental variables approach. Both identification strategies suggest that analyst coverage has a negative causal effect on CSR. Analyst coverage seems to influence CSR activities via analysts' influence on the value of managerial ownership and discretionary spending. My findings are consistent with the view that spending on CSR is a manifestation of an agency problem and that financial analysts curb such discretionary spending by disciplining managers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Analyst Following; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Monitoring,,,"Bénabou, Roland, Individual and corporate social responsibility, Economica, 77, 305, pp. 1-19, (2010); Brennan, Michael J., Investment analysis and price formation in securities markets, Journal of Financial Economics, 38, 3, pp. 361-381, (1995); Chen, Tao, Do analysts matter for governance?

F., AVRDC - The World Vegetable Center, Tainan, Taiwan","After gaining independence in 1991, countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus have been rebuilding their economies along more market-driven lines. National governments have implemented policy reforms to transform agriculture and research, and, as a result of these measures, agricultural production is gradually increasing across the region. Over the past decade, the sown area of vegetables in the region has expanded, to reach 770,881 ha in 2012. Vegetable production increased to more than 20 million t in 2012. Consistent policies to advance food security are needed to address the needs of the 82 million people living in the region. Several constraints hinder market-oriented vegetable production. Although total vegetable production has increased due to an increase in sown area, average yields throughout the region are still low. Vegetable cultivation in the region is seasonal and supplies are erratic. The vegetable seed production system must be re-established. Vegetable research is limited. Policies and strategies to improve crop productivity systems include the sustainable use of vegetable diversity to develop improved, well-adapted cultivars. The introduction of innovative production technologies will increase the yield, quality and safety of vegetables including melons. Developing infrastructure for a year-round vegetable supply can improve consumption and nutrition. A stronger postharvest market chain based on improved handling and processing technologies, standardization and quality certification will enhance export opportunities.

However, insurance companies normally operate on a one year time horizon - underwriting risks through policies which change each year to reflect new knowledge of these risks. The ClimateWise principles is a voluntary initiative of the insurance sector that was launched in 2007 to provide a basis for insurance companies to engage with climate change risks. This paper introduces the ClimateWise initiative and explores progress made since its launch. The paper presents new knowledge on whether this voluntary initiative provides a useful structure for the insurance sector in responding to the challenge of climate change. It finds that while the insurance sector has engaged with climate change, there is much more to do and we welcome the recent changes to ClimateWise that more accurately reflect this. The paper concludes that ClimateWise has been a useful initiative for the insurance companies and as a potential benchmark for the sector it offers some value. However, ClimateWise has not provided a strong enough engagement across the sector to embed climate action into business decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Business Initiatives; Climate Change; Corporate Engagement; Insurance; Principles; Voluntary; Insurance; Risk Management; Business Decisions; Climate Change Risks; Corporate Engagement; Insurance Companies; Insurance Sectors; Principles; Voluntary; Voluntary Initiatives; Climate Change,Insurance; Risk management; Business decisions; Climate change risks; Corporate engagement; Insurance companies; Insurance sectors; Principles; Voluntary; Voluntary initiatives; Climate change,,"undefined; Alberini, Anna, Assessing voluntary programs to improve environmental quality, Environmental and Resource Economics, 22, 1-2, pp. 157-184, (2002); undefined; Climatewise Statement on the Unfccc Copenhagen Negotiations, (2009); undefined, (2013); undefined; Global Environmental Politics, (2003); Floods Health and Climate Change A Strategic Review, (2004); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2008)",,Elsevier Ltd,,09596526,,JCROE,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991472282,

To design sustainable processes based on renewable sources and/or to compare fuels and technologies in view of their sustainability, a simple 3-D metric has been developed. It involves production and investment costs, the effect of the facility on the generation of jobs, the emissions of carbon dioxide, due to the consumption of energy and water, and their mitigation, due to the production of renewable based commodities and chemicals. The carbon tax is used to normalize the contribution of the use of resources and the substitution of products by the renewable counterparts into an economic basis. The metric is region specific. It can be used as objective function in process synthesis or as an offline tool for sustainability assessment. In this paper, a large number of biofuels, including several processing paths, and processes for the production of chemicals or power from solar and wind have been evaluated using the metric. The results show that the processes that generate a surplus of energy, like FT fuels, are more sustainable because of their emission mitigation potential. Furthermore, water availability determines the sustainability of solar based facilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Multiobjective Optimization; Process Design; Renewable Based Processes; Sustainability Assessment; Carbon Dioxide; Ecodesign; Fuels; Investments; Multiobjective Optimization; Process Design; Consumption Of Energy; Economic Performance; Emission Mitigation; Objective Functions; Renewable Sources; Sustainability Assessment; Sustainable Process; Water Availability; Sustainable Development; Biofuel; Carbon Dioxide; Design Method; Emission Control; Energy Use; Environmental Impact; Optimization; Pollution Tax; Renewable Resource; Resource Use; Social Impact; Solar Power; Water Availability; Wind Power,Carbon dioxide; Ecodesign; Fuels; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Process design; Consumption of energy; Economic performance; Emission mitigation; Objective functions; Renewable sources; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable process; Water availability; Sustainable development; biofuel; carbon dioxide; design method; emission control; energy use; environmental impact; optimization; pollution tax; renewable resource; resource use; social impact; solar power; water availability; wind power,,"Martín, Mariano, On the systematic synthesis of sustainable biorefineries, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 52, 9, pp. 3044-3064, (2013); undefined, (1998); Sikdar, Subhas K., Sustainable development and sustainability metrics, AIChE Journal, 49, 8, pp. 1928-1932, (2003); Schwarz, Jeanette M., Use sustainability metrics to guide decision-making, Chemical Engineering Progress, 98, 7, pp. 58-63, (2002); Filho, Eduardo Romeiro, Brazilian design for sustainability: In search of a local approach, Journal of Cleaner Production, 107, pp. 467-474, (2015); Sinnott, Ray K., Chemical Engineering Design, (2013); Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers, (2003); Gebreslassie, Berhane Gebreslassie, Design of environmentally conscious absorption cooling systems via multi-objective optimization and life cycle assessment, Applied Energy, 86, 9, pp. 1712-1722, (2009); Gebreslassie, Berhane Gebreslassie, Life cycle optimization for sustainable design and operations of hydrocarbon biorefinery via fast pyrolysis, hydrotreating and hydrocracking, Computers and Chemical Engineering, 50, pp. 71-91, (2013); Greet 1 0 Transportation Fuel Cycles Model Methodology and Use, (1996)",,Elsevier Ltd,,03605442; 18736785,0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808,ENEYD,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983491107,

Three interrelated arguments regarding the shifting private authority of leading UKand US-based TINCs are presented. First, contributions to the period of economic instability that began in 2007 have destabilized the long-standing authority of Anglo-American firms including Bloomberg, Dow Jones, and Thomson Reuters. Second, through their involvement in two overtly normative niches of global finance, environmental and Islamic finance, these private actors have responded to contestations of their authority with an enhanced stress on moral authority since 2007. Third, a mere tinkering around with pre-crisis technical knowledge and a persistent reliance on liberal market values is likely to perpetuate rather than resolve the unstable authority of the leading TINCs. Based on an original analysis of primary documents and interviews undertaken with industry participants, this article contributes to existing literature analyzing the changing nature of private authority by revealing limits to shifts and combinations between its moral and technical forms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Communications Policy and the Public Interest the Telecommunications Act of 1996, (1999); Auld, Graeme, Can technological innovations improve private regulation in the global economy?, Business and Politics, 12, 3, (2010); Best, Jacqueline, Moralizing finance: The new financial architecture as ethical discourse, Review of International Political Economy, 10, 3, pp. 579-603, (2003); Best, Jacqueline, The limits of financial risk management: Or what we didn't learn from the Asian crisis, New Political Economy, 15, 1, pp. 29-49, (2010); 2012 Sustainability Report, (2012); Brassett, James, International political economy and the question of ethics, Review of International Political Economy, 17, 3, pp. 425-453, (2010); Paterson Review of International Affairs, (2013); Carrick-Hagenbarth, Jessica, Dangerous interconnectedness: Economists' conflicts of interest, ideology and financial crisis, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 36, 1, pp. 43-63, (2012); Cetina, Karin Knorr, Global microstructures: The virtual societies of financial markets, American Journal of Sociology, 107, 4, pp. 905-950, (2002); Global Co2 Market Growth Stalls in 2010 Amid Uncertainty, (2011)",,Walter de Gruyter GmbH info@degruyter.com,,14693569; 13695258,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983271789,

As part of the COP21 side events, on December 4th the Lima Paris Action Agenda presented a half-day of presentations and round table discussions titled Focus on Private Finance. The event was supported by the Secretary-General of the United Nation, Caisse des Dépôts, and the I4CE Institute for Climate Economics. This conference report summarizes the findings of the session and the messages delivered by finance industry representatives. Significant investment in low carbon assets is required to maintain global temperature increases below 2 °C. The two resounding themes throughout the session were that in order to attract capital for low carbon investments fossil fuel subsidies must end and a higher carbon price is needed to incentivise investment. Furthermore, accounting and regulatory bodies need to implement more stringent disclosure and reporting requirements so that climate risk is properly understood by investors. There is significant appetite for investment in the low carbon sector which is demonstrated by the growth in the green bond market. Financial institutions have a role to play in aggregating, structuring and de-risking investments to facilitate private finance investment. Policy makers also need to improve the investment environment by creating consistent and stable long term policies which will give investors' confidence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Actions; Capital; Cop21; Finance; Investment; Private; Carbon; Economics; Environmental Regulations; Finance; Fossil Fuels; Global Warming; Actions; Capital; Cop21; Finance Industries; Financial Institution; Global Temperatures; Private; United Nations Framework Convention On Climate Changes; Investments,Carbon; Economics; Environmental regulations; Finance; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Actions; Capital; COP21; Finance industries; Financial institution; Global temperatures; Private; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Investments,"The private finance session comprised opening remarks, two keynote speeches, three presentation sessions, a roundtable discussion and concluding remarks.

It appears, then, that either the inroads made by the RI community have not kept up with the increase in unsustainable practices, or, that the RI process itself has been ineffective at producing meaningful change. The current study aims to investigate the practices used by pension plan sponsors to determine how they may enable, or interfere with, the adoption of implementation of RI. We adopt Framing Theory (Benford and Snow, Annual Review of Sociology 26:611–639, 2000), specifically the idea that particular frames find alignment when they resonate with their targets, by either bridging, extending, amplifying or transforming a domain. We extend research to include understudied practices by performing an analysis of 60 public pension funds in Canada. We find evidence of disconnect between the financial frame which dominates practices for compliance and evaluation, and the social frame of RI as a source of change. If the aim of RI is to produce long-term change, then a consideration of whether it aligns with extant practices is critical. We discover a variety of frame alignment tactics already employed in practice. We also find that, even within the dominant financial frame, opportunities for frame extension, amplification and transformation do exist, and examine how these are more (or less) possible depending on how the asset management structure is designed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Framing; Investment Monitoring; Pension Funds; Responsible Investing,,"The financial frame within the compliance domain produces particular strategies related to investment practices.

The objective of this research note is to examine whether the French SRI market, by focusing more on financial rather than on ethical considerations, compared with other countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, or even Sweden, may lead to a form of “mainstreaming” of SRI processes. The authors explore several convergent mechanisms. First, the authors analyze the importance of the mainstreaming issue in the history of SRI as well as in the contemporaneous debate in the academic literature on the links between financial and extrafinancial (SRI) performance. Second, the authors review the role played by ethical finance laws adopted in France in the early 2000s in the development of the SRI market.

However, market structure has been used as a theoretical model to inform PES design. Based on 16 cases from Andean and Mesoamerican countries, we analyze whether PES schemes have, since their implementation, gradually incorporated more market characteristics or whether and to what extent these schemes have changed towards more reliance on command-based mechanisms. The schemes analyzed cover a range of governance mechanisms, from small markets to almost complete hierarchical organization. Our results suggest that over time an increasing number of the schemes have incorporated characteristics of a hierarchy to organize ecosystem service users. Mostly through the use of taxes/tariffs and by governments acting directly on users' behalf. Contractual agreements, with payment levels either bilaterally negotiated or set by intermediaries, and providers being mainly individual and communal landholders, remain at the core of most schemes studied. Intermediaries are important actors in almost all schemes analyzed. They organize and/or represent users, and are usually national or local governments. The evolution of the schemes analyzed suggests that there is no convergence towards a market for ecosystem services, but an increasing complexity in the schemes' design. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ecosystem Services; Evolution; Governance; Hybrids; Markets; Pes,,"This research was made possible thanks to funding from the Flemish Interuniversity Council-University Development Cooperation (Flanders, Belgium) (VLIR-UOS reference no: 2010-05).

More specifically, the authors ask to what extent financial markets foster and facilitate more sustainable business practices. The authors highlight that their current role is rather modest and conclude that, on the old paths, a paradoxical situation exists. On one hand, financial market participants increasingly integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into their investment decisions, whereas on the other hand, in terms of organizational reality, there seems to be no real shift toward more sustainable business practices. The authors identify two main challenges within the field of sustainable investments that are relevant for entering new avenues that may help overcome this situation. First, a reorientation toward a long-term paradigm for sustainable investments is important. Second, ESG data must become more trustworthy. From a theoretical point of view, the authors finally highlight the potential market consequences when ESG investment criteria are used. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",And Governance (esg) Data; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental; Long-term Paradigm; Social; Sustainable Investments; Systems Perspective,,,"Barnett, Michael L., Stakeholder influence capacity and the variability of financial returns to corporate social responsibility, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 794-816, (2007); Barnett, Michael L., Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 11, pp. 1101-1122, (2006); Barton, Dominic, Focusing capital on the long term, Harvard Business Review, JAN-FEB, (2014); Financial Analysts Journal, (2010); Geography of Shareholder Engagement Evidence from A Large British Institutional Investor, (2013); Bauer, Rob M.M.J., The ethical mutual fund performance debate: New evidence from Canada, Journal of Business Ethics, 70, 2, pp. 111-124, (2007); Corporate Environmental Management and Credit Risk, (2010); Bauer, Rob M.M.J., International evidence on ethical mutual fund performance and investment style, Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, 7, pp. 1751-1767, (2005); Determinants of Withdrawn Shareholder Proposals, (2011); Bear, Stephen, The Impact of Board Diversity and Gender Composition on Corporate Social Responsibility and Firm Reputation, Journal of Business Ethics, 97, 2, pp. 207-221, (2010)",,SAGE Publications Ltd info@sagepub.co.uk,,00076503; 15524205,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957800796,

It concluded that climate change is “unequivocal” and human activities are the dominant cause. Avoidance of “dangerous” climate change will require sustained substantial reductions of emissions by mid-century and that net emissions decrease to zero before 2100. This paper describes, reviews and explains the place of tourism in AR5 and AR5's relevance for tourism's future, including impacts, adaptation, vulnerabilities, and mitigation. Tourism's position in AR5 has strengthened, particularly with respect to the recognition of transboundary impacts, the sector's contribution to climate change and its mitigation requirements. Major regional knowledge gaps persist. A lack of understanding of the integrated impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of adaptation strategies potentially hinders the development of resilient tourism operations and destinations. Uncertainties regarding tourist response to climate change impacts and mitigation policy impede predictions of tourism demand. The implications of different decarbonization pathways for the future of international tourism represent a key knowledge gap. The limited response of key tourism organizations to AR5 contributes to the risks climate change poses to the sector. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Climate Change; Development; Emissions; Impacts; Mitigation; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Ecotourism; Emission Control; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change; Mitigation; Tourist Destination,adaptive management; climate change; ecotourism; emission control; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mitigation; tourist destination,,"Tourism Review International, (2008); Arent, Douglas J., Key economic sectors and services, pp. 659-708, (2015); J Sustain Tourism, (2007); Becken, Susanne, A review of tourism and climate change as an evolving knowledge domain, Tourism Management Perspectives, 6, pp. 53-62, (2013); Tourism and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation from Policy to Practice, (2012); Climate Change 2007 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2007); Use of Internal Carbon Price by Companies as Incentive and Strategic Planning Tool, (2013); Secretary Hagel on Climate Change Affecting the Security Environment, (2014); Physical Risks from Climate Change A Guide for Companies and Investors on Disclosure and Management of Climate Impacts, (2011); Fiduciary Duty and Climate Change Disclosure, (2012)",,Routledge info@tandf.co.uk,,17477646; 09669582,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948588302,

Air transport corporations need a strong sustainability management framework to effectively manage economic, environmental and social risks to achieve their corporate sustainability objectives, and to meet their stakeholders' demands. This book offers a new Enterprise Sustainability Risk Management (ESRM) model to fulfill these requirements. In the model presented, the triple bottom line (TBL) agenda is incorporated into the companies' sustainability management. ESRM deals with the environmental, social, and ecological risks as well as the strategic, economic, operational, and threat risks of companies. The best corporate sustainability strategies and management approaches require the consideration of all corporate risks in both a holistic and systematic way. Flouris and Kucuk Yilmaz present an effective way to manage sustainability risks via a new, well-designed, integrated, dynamic and flexible framework.

The contemporaneous condition of global luxury markets has led luxury brands into an unprecedented proliferation of products, as customers especially in emerging economies crave for the latest luxury items. The democratization phenomenon of mainstream fashion has also enveloped the luxury sector in a wasteful consumption pattern of global proportions which does not bode well in sustainability terms. Indeed, the rapid depletion of the Earth’s natural resources indicates that both the fashion and the luxury sector are culprits in this environmental deterioration. Remedial actions are urgently needed, and the deceleration of fashion and luxury consumption is one of the suggested strategies. Deceleration combined with competitiveness may seem to be a perplexing task for luxury companies to tackle; however, there is an example in the luxury sector where slowness and competitiveness not only coexist but also thrive. The bespoke tailors in Savile Row, London, have demonstrated that competitive advantage can be achieved in a dense network of cooperation and competition. The authors have employed the relational view of the firm to identify that network resources can be applied to the slow tailoring craft and constitute a competitive strategy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bespoke Tailoring; Competitiveness; Network Resources; Slow Fashion Movement; Sustainable Luxury,,,"End of Fashion how Marketing Changed the Clothing Business Forever, (1999); Tailors of Savile Row the New York Times, (1981); Nicomachean Ethics; Handbook of Qualitative Research, (1994); Atwal, Glyn, Luxury brand marketing - The experience is everything!, Journal of Brand Management, 16, 5-6, pp. 338-346, (2009); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Sloan Management Review, (1999); New World of Luxury Caught Between Growing Momentum and Lasting Change, (2010); Elegant Disruption how Luxury and Society can Change Each Other for Good Asia Pacific Work in Progress Research Papers Series, (2012); Deeper Luxury, (2007)",,Springer,,2345766X; 23457651,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075860297,

Although legislative and regulatory actions have been lagging, some businesses have emerged as leaders in this process. In particular, financial institutions as information producers and resource allocators play an important role. In order to accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon economy, market participants need to develop the ability to identify and support firms that are leading on climate change action. Using CDP data on ten climate change action metrics for 2013, the authors apply the dichotomous Rasch model to rank the overall climate change action performance of U.S. financial firms across multiple dimensions of this effort. Simultaneously, the results identify the climate change action metrics for which success was most difficult to achieve. The authors show that investors, managers and regulators should consider ranking firms using this more comprehensive methodology rather than the CDP's Performance Band or the CDP's Disclosure Score alone when assessing firm leadership in this area.

Sustainability is an important endeavor which takes into account not only the environment but also economic and social factors. Therefore, this concept implies some interdependence between the three dimensions, so neither can exist without the other. However, companies concerns are many and various so only some of them manage to fully engage in sustainable development. Projected indicators in reporting initiatives are mainly partial fulfilled by companies. Because of this, climate change issues also intervene and they are affecting the world more and more. Concerns and activities of people and companies are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions that lead to these changes. In case the emissions of greenhouse gases would fall in legal standards, the situation would change. This is the purpose of this paper, to highlight the minimum requirements to be met by companies to contribute to sustainable development and to present a review of the current situation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ghg; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Principles; Climate Change; Economics; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Information Management; Innovation; Planning; Current Situation; Legal Standards; Minimum Requirements; Social Factor; Sustainable Principles; Three Dimensions; Sustainable Development,Climate change; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Innovation; Planning; Current situation; Legal standards; Minimum requirements; Social factor; Sustainable principles; Three dimensions; Sustainable development,,"Artene, Alin Emanuel, The role of accounting information for a sustainible development within farming entities in Romania case study banat Region, pp. 1655-1665, (2015); 4th International Conference on Social Sciences and Society, (2015); Marius, Cioca, Web technologies and multi-criterion analysis used in enterprise integration, Studies in Informatics and Control, 20, 2, pp. 129-134, (2011); Macrotheme Review A Multidisciplinary Journal of Global Macro Trends, (2013); Draghici, A., On-line training and certification solution for business process managers, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 219 CCIS, PART 1, pp. 380-389, (2011); Sustainable Development, (2015); Csm, (2002); Figge, Frank, Is green and profitable sustainable?

Design/methodology/approach-The study utilizes multiple theories that are commonly used by corporate social responsibility studies to explain the corporate ecological transparency. Based on a sample of 243 Global 500 firms, the authors examine the impact of shareholders' interest in ecological information, creditors' concern, firm size, industry membership, the presence of emission trading scheme (ETS), stringency of environmental regulations on corporate ecological transparency. Findings-The paper documents evidence that larger firms, firms in GHG-intensive sectors, and highly leveraged firms tend to produce more ecological disclosures. In addition, ecological transparency is higher in countries with an ETS and increases with more stringent environmental regulation. Finally, the authors find little evidence that shareholders of these firms are concerned with this information. Research limitations/implications-The sample is restricted to the largest firms with relevant carbon profile information. Thus, caution should be exercised when generalizing the inferences. Practical implications-Sustainability has become one of the most importance topics in business agenda. Firms' attitude and decision about the ecological transparency will affect internal firm performance, external stakeholder engagement, and policy makers' attention. It determines the firms' long-term operation and development. Originality/value-The study contributes to the literature by utilizing multiple theories to explain ecological transparency. Each of the theories provided only a partial explanation for ecological transparency. Thus, we need to consider the firms' behaviors from multiple dimensions. In particular, stakeholder theory and institutional theory are the dominant perspectives accounting for managers' propensity to disclose a firm's ecological footprint. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Disclosure Project (cdp); Ecological Transparency; Greenhouse Gas (ghg) Emissions; Sustainability,,,"Adams, Carol A., Internal organisational factors influencing corporate social and ethical reporting: Beyond current theorising, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 15, 2, pp. 223-250, (2002); Adams, Carol A., A commentary on: Corporate social responsibility reporting and reputation risk management, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 21, 3, pp. 365-370, (2008); Adams, Carol A., Engaging with organisations in pursuit of improved sustainability accounting and performance, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 20, 3, pp. 333-355, (2007); Aerts, Walter, Corporate environmental disclosure, financial markets and the media: An international perspective, Ecological Economics, 64, 3, pp. 643-659, (2008); Al-Tuwaijri, Sulaiman A., The relations among environmental disclosure, environmental performance, and economic performance: A simultaneous equations approach, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 29, 5-6, pp. 447-471, (2004); Archel Domench, Pablo, Social disclosure, legitimacy theory and the role of the state, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 22, 8, pp. 1284-1307, (2009); Baker, Max L., Re-conceiving managerial capture, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 23, 7, pp. 847-867, (2010); Business Strategy and the Environment, (2000); Banerjee, Subhabrata Bobby, Corporate Social Responsibility: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, (2007); Banerjee, Subhabrata Bobby, Stakeholder management and sustainability strategies in the French nuclear industry, Business Strategy and the Environment, 20, 2, pp. 124-140, (2011)",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

While the debate over whether divestment is in line with fiduciary duty continues, there is some consensus that divestment, in theory, is consistent with meeting fiduciary duty. Yet, in practice, institutions fear divesting due to a lack of clear law on the issue and fiduciary standards that discourage departure from the status quo. The relatively new movement has largely avoided the courts up to this point. However, in November 2014, a group of Harvard students paved the way with a lawsuit against Harvard alleging claims of (1) ""mismanagement of charitable funds"" and (2) ""intentional investment in abnormally dangerous activities"" for failing to divest from fossil fuel stocks. Previous literature on the subject has focused on legislative and regulatory solutions rather than looking at possible legal claims that could compel divestment under current laws. The Harvard suit suggests, however, that there is a role for courts to play; litigation might be the only viable solution as legislative and regulatory attempts are moving too slowly and ineffectively to deal with the pressing nature of climate change. This Note argues that courts should recognize the special threat posed by climate change to humanity as well as to portfolio risks and returns, take an expansive view of the special duties charitable institutions and public entities owe, and require charitable and public institutions to take into account the effects of climate change when making investment decisions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Swarthmore Mountain Justice; Palmer, Margaret A., Mountaintop mining consequences, Science, 327, 5962, pp. 148-149, (2010); Remarks by the President at the National Defense University, (2013); Remarks by the President at the Glacier Conference Anchorage, (2015); Swarthmore Mountain Justice Institutional Memory Document, (2012); United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (1992); United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Un Special Rapporteur Mapping Report on Climate Change and Human Rights, (2014); Submission of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (2015); Climate Progress, (2012)",,Columbia Law Review Association EIC@columbialawreview.org,,00101923,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962082150,

Three case studies are developed, analyzing both private and public investment decisions and the interplay between regulations, acting as various incentives or disincentives. In Vietnam, dynamic urbanization is linked to political liberalization in terms of migration, private industries, land markets and urban planning. This has resulted in rapid urban growth, thereby increasing risk through urban sprawl into hazard prone areas that had previously been kept clear of urban development. In northwestern Spain, the ""A Frouxeira"" seashore lagoon and wetland are severely threatened by agriculture expansion, dune mining, tree plantations, tourism and the Prestige oil spill in 2002, which placed significant pressures on this fragile ecosystem, leading to social and environmental conflicts. Finally in Nepal, poor food security, landslides and changing climate conditions are pushing people out of mountainous areas to the plains and abroad, leading to illegal settlements springing up in flood-prone riverbanks. Governance is inadequate to prevent these illegal settlements but the city has now become liable for the safety of persons residing in these dangerous areas.These cases highlight how private and public investments at various levels are increasing risks and what public solutions are envisaged, if at all, to address these risks, while highlighting the difficult trade-offs between development, risk and governance. Perhaps one of the strongest arguments in favor of risk sensitive land use planning is its cost-effectiveness, considering the high costs of structural measures to reducing risk. This can include ecosystem-based approaches as part of integrated planning, an often overlooked element of DRR for mitigating hazards, reducing vulnerabilities by providing livelihood resources and even exposure when dangerous areas are converted to green belts. Finally, we conclude that more effective risk reduction is possible through improved spatial planning. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ecosystem-based Approaches To Disaster Risk Reduction; Nepal; Risk Governance; Risk Sensitive Land Use Planning; Spain; Vietnam,,,"A Special Report of Working Groups I and II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2012); Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Revealing Risk Redefining Development, (2011); undefined, (2012); Terminology Website, (2009); Poverty and Famines an Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation, (1981); At Risk Natural Hazards People S Vulnerability and Disasters, (2004); Burby, Raymond J., Unleashing the power of planning to create Disaster-Resistant communities, Journal of the American Planning Association, 65, 3, pp. 247-258, (1999); Cooperating with Nature Confronting Natural Hazards with Land Use Planning for Sustainable Communities, (1998); Cooperating with Nature Confronting Natural Hazards with Land Use Planning for Sustainable Communities, (1998); Greiving, Stefan, Linking the actors and policies throughout the disaster management cycle by ""agreement on Objectives"" - A new output-oriented management approach, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 12, 4, pp. 1085-1107, (2012)",,Elsevier Ltd,,22124209,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949533980,

Research has yet to assess empirically how accounting expertise is deployed as a ‘public practice’ to influence sustainability reporting. To address this gap, I explore the emergence of the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), and the way it uses accounting expertise to shape climate change risk reporting. While it is clear that professional accountants are playing a more significant role in risk disclosure, the CDSB is a form of ‘experimental governance’ that exposes accounting expertise to uncertainty and contestation. Indeed, the CDSB reconstitutes a ‘public space’ within the field of accounting where the link between accounting standards and sustainability reporting is exposed to environmental politics rather than subverted into market-friendly debate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accounting; Climate Change Risk; Experimental Governance; Financialization; Climate Change; Environmental Politics; Financial Market; Governance Approach; Nonprofit Organization; Risk Assessment; Sustainability,climate change; environmental politics; financial market; governance approach; nonprofit organization; risk assessment; sustainability,This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) [grant number 756 2013 0569].,"Re the Climate Disclosure Standards Board Cdsb Reporting Framework, (2009); Amcor Comments on Cdsb Framework, (2009); Andonova, Liliana B., Transnational climate governance, Global Environmental Politics, 9, 2, pp. 52-73, (2009); Regulation Governance, (2007); Return of the Public in Global Governance, (2014); BT Comment, (2009); Campbell-Verduyn, Malcolm, Experimentalism in European Union and global financial governance: Interactions, contrasts, and implications, Journal of European Public Policy, 21, 3, pp. 408-429, (2014); Carbon Disclosure Project, (2010); Global 500 Climate Change Report 2013, (2013); Basis for Conclusions in Exposure Draft the Climate Standards Disclosure Board Reporting Framework, (2009)",,Routledge,,09644016,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940961284,

Adopting the property investor's perspective, this paper focuses on financial performance of energy audit investments of existing office buildings. The study uses four property investment methods for assessing the financial performance of these investments. First, the paper adopts the traditional approach for assessing the profitability of an energy conservation investment: payback period, internal rates of returns and returns on investments of energy efficiency investments. Secondly, the scope is moved from energy investment to the property level and discounted cash flow (DCF) method is used to analyze the influence of the investments on the actual property value, something that has not been studied enough. The results reveal genuine financial advantages of energy efficiency investments at the building portfolio level, highlighting positive impacts on the property values of ca. 2.5 percent on average. Yet, the benefits of energy efficiency investments are currently not easily reached nor realized by investors. This is at least partly due to the mechanisms of distributing the potential returns of the investments between stakeholders, the lack of qualified service providers and poor understanding of overall value of energy conservation investments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Discounted Cash Flow; Energy Audit; Energy Efficiency; Offices; Property Values,,"The authors would like to thank KTI Property Information Ltd and Catella Property Ltd. for providing market information for the purposes of this research.

The category of ‘semi-professionals’ is extended to actors whose legitimization of professional privileges remains precarious as their ‘thin’ congruence with narrow principles impedes broader correspondence with wider social values. The ‘thin’ congruence with narrow notions of sustainability by leading British and American accounting firms, banks and credit-rating agencies since the outbreak of the most recent financial crisis is illustrated as contributing to their persistent ‘semi-professionalism’.

This paper aims to develop the understanding of how institutional investors in the private sector perceive barriers to scaling up investment into clean energy infrastructure and what policy solutions to those barriers they advocate. This paper adds to existing scientific knowledge through a clear focus on private sector perceptions. Through the analysis of previous public statements from organisations and coalitions in the finance sector a number of investment barriers were identified. These initial barriers fed into a Delphi process. The outputs of the Delphi process were categorized into five sets of barriers and a number of policy solutions associated with investing into clean energy solutions. We conclude that there is a need for better engagement with the institutional investment community to ensure further effort on policy development that underpins investments at scale is effective and efficient. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Infrastructure Investment; Institutional Investor; Investment Barrier; Policy; Climate Change; Public Policy; Climate Change Mitigation; Infrastructure Investment; Institutional Investments; Institutional Investors; National Policies; Policy Development; Political Negotiations; Scientific Knowledge; Investments,Climate change; Public policy; Climate change mitigation; Infrastructure investment; Institutional investments; Institutional investors; National policies; Policy development; Political negotiations; Scientific knowledge; Investments,"The author acknowledges a grant from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change to support the development of the work with the Capital Markets Climate Initiative (CMCI).

The contemporaneous condition of global luxury markets has led luxury brands into an unprecedented proliferation of products, as customers especially in emerging economies crave for the latest luxury items. The democratization phenomenon of mainstream fashion has also enveloped the luxury sector in a wasteful consumption pattern of global proportions which does not bode well in sustainability terms. Indeed, the rapid depletion of the Earth's natural resources indicates that both the fashion and the luxury sector are culprits in this environmental deterioration. Remedial actions are urgently needed, and the deceleration of fashion and luxury consumption is one of the suggested strategies. Deceleration combined with competitiveness may seem to be a perplexing task for luxury companies to tackle; however, there is an example in the luxury sector where slowness and competitiveness not only coexist but also thrive. The bespoke tailors in Savile Row, London, have demonstrated that competitive advantage can be achieved in a dense network of cooperation and competition. The authors have employed the relational view of the firm to identify that network resources can be applied to the slow tailoring craft and constitute a competitive strategy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bespoke Tailoring; Competitiveness; Network Resources; Slow Fashion Movement; Sustainable Luxury; Competition; Bespoke Tailoring; Competitiveness; Network Resource; Slow Fashion Movement; Sustainable Luxury; Sustainable Development,Competition; Bespoke tailoring; Competitiveness; Network resource; Slow fashion movement; Sustainable luxury; Sustainable development,,"End of Fashion how Marketing Changed the Clothing Business Forever, (1999); Tailors of Savile Row, (1981); Nicomachean Ethics; Handbook of Qualitative Research, (1994); Atwal, Glyn, Luxury brand marketing - The experience is everything!, Journal of Brand Management, 16, 5-6, pp. 338-346, (2009); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Sloan Management Review, (1999); Bespoke and Built to Last in the Finest Savile Style, (2013); New World of Luxury Caught Between Growing Momentum and Lasting Change, (2010); Elegant Disruption how Luxury and Society can Change Each Other for Good, (2012)",,Springer Singapore,,,9789812877420; 9789812877413; 9789812876331; 9789812876324,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956491716,

We investigate this for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) work stream on addressing loss and damage (L&D). This paper presents evidence of current engagement and expectations, from official submissions to the UNFCCC, L&D literature, and relates this to experiences from the fields of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). Results show a degree of 'vagueness' in outlining the role of the private sector with unclear conceptual boundaries of L&D, DRR and CCA posing challenges for stakeholders. Expectation that the private sector will support the emerging L&D framework through knowledge, skills and resource, particularly in developed countries, is apparent.

Non-financial data reporting contributes to increased transparency, predictability of companies' operations and hence to significant reduction in information asymmetry on the capital market, and ultimately considerably reduces forecasting errors in risk-return profile of investment portfolios. The research conducted has shown that there is a large information gap on the Polish market, especially as regards ESG reporting. The overall level of reporting on non-financial data is low. In the analysed period, the shares issued by companies with higher ESG rating were distinguished by an over-average return rate and lower return rate volatility as well as lower forecasting error in return rates, which is indicated by the standard error parameter (alpha and beta coefficients). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Capital; Financial Market; Investment; Risk Assessment; Poland,capital; financial market; investment; risk assessment; Poland,,"Accounting Act of 29 September, (1994); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Demystifying Responsible Investment Performance A Review of Key Academic and Broker Research on Esg Factors, (2007); undefined, (2012); Campbell, John Y., Have individual stocks become more volatile?

In this paper, we reconstructed an evaluation criterion with 32 indicators for ECRM performance of banks, and selected 120 sample banks from 12 countries in this region for a comparative study. We conducted a gap analysis among banks with systematic ECRM and those with preliminary ECRM, suggesting that five indicators need to be improved by the former and 12 indicators caused gaps of the latter. We found banks in different countries with different ECRM performance levels: the Canadian, US and Japanese banks performed the best; the banks from Australia, Republic of Korea, China and Thailand had modest performance and the banks from the other five countries had a low level of performance. The influential factors of policy, voluntary code and green income incentive for banks' ECRM performance are discussed with the results of a correspondence analysis graph and policy practice in several representative countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Asia-pacific Region; Commercial Bank; Comparative Study; Environmental Credit Risk Management; Equator Principles; Sustainable Finance,,,"Aintablian, Sebouh, Bank monitoring and environmental risk, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 34, 1-2, pp. 389-401, (2007); Aizawa, Motoko, Green credit, green stimulus, green revolution? china's mobilization of banks for environmental cleanup, Journal of Environment and Development, 19, 2, pp. 119-144, (2010); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., Credit risk measurement: Developments over the last 20 years, Journal of Banking and Finance, 21, 11-12, pp. 1721-1742, (1997); Corporate Social Responsibility, (2011); Boyer, Marcel, Environmental risks and bank liability, European Economic Review, 41, 8, pp. 1427-1459, (1997); Boyer, Marcel, The impact of court errors on liability sharing and safety regulation for environmental/industrial accidents, International Review of Law and Economics, 31, 1, pp. 21-29, (2011); Caouette, John B., Managing Credit Risk: The Great Challenge for the Global Financial Markets: Second Edition, (2011); Environmental Risk Management and Corporate Lending A Global Perspective, (1999); Global Citizenship Report, (2011)",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,09644733; 10990836,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925392028,

Bat assemblages may be negatively affected by wind farms due to the fatality of a significant number of individuals after colliding with the moving turbines or experiencing barotrauma. The implementation of wind farms should follow standard procedures to prevent such negative impacts: avoid, reduce and offset, in what is known as the mitigation hierarchy. According to this approach avoiding impacts is the priority, followed by the minimisation of the identified impacts, and finally, when residual negative impacts still remain, those must be offset or at least compensated. This paper presents a review on conservation measures for bats and presents some guidelines within the compensation scenario, focusing on negative impacts that remain after avoidance and minimisation measures. The conservation strategies presented aim at the improvement of the ecological conditions for the bat assemblage as a whole. While developed under the European context, the proposed measures are potentially applicable elsewhere, taking into consideration the specificity of each region in terms of bat assemblages present, landscape features and policy context regarding nature and biodiversity conservation and management. An analysis of potential opportunities and constraints arising from the implementation of offset/compensation programmes and gaps in the current knowledge is also considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bats; Impacts; Mitigation Hierarchy; Offsets/compensation Measures; Wind Farms; Biodiversity; Conservation; Electric Utilities; Bats; Impacts; Mitigation Hierarchy; Offsets/compensation Measures; Wind Farm; Wind Power; Bat; Biodiversity; Compensation System; Conservation Management; Ecological Impact; Guideline; Policy Approach; Wind Farm; Europe,Biodiversity; Conservation; Electric utilities; Bats; Impacts; Mitigation hierarchy; Offsets/compensation measures; Wind farm; Wind power; bat; biodiversity; compensation system; conservation management; ecological impact; guideline; policy approach; wind farm; Europe,"The work developed in this manuscript is part of the project R&D project, CENTRO-07-0202-FEDER-011541 Wind & Biodiversity, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), under the Regional Operational Programme of Center (Mais Centro).

This impacts strategic considerations in the industry and changes the immediate prospects of individual business areas and products. The authors of this chapter argue that financial institutions will face further potentially bigger challenges in the next 15 years. They propose a strategic tool to prepare for these challenges. The so-called handprint approach applies an expanded value concept. It reflects the economic, social and environmental added value generated by a financial institution. In contrast to exclusively risk-centred sustainability approaches, it opens up ways to make sustainability a driver of business development, proactive reputation management and capacity building. This chapter describes the handprint approach and relates it to major concepts such as integrated reporting. It further provides applied examples for how other industries start using the handprint approach and points out potential implications of this trend for the financial industry. Finally, it names specific starting points for using the handprint approach to increase the future viability of financial institutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Risk; Equity Owner; Financial Industry; Financial Institution; Human Resource Development,,,"undefined; Aodp Global Climate Index 2012 Results, (2012); Deutsche Bank Research Aktuelle Themen, (2011); undefined; undefined; Quarterly Journal of Economic Research, (2004); undefined; Zeitschrift Fur Internationale Und Kapitalmarktorientierte Rechnungslegung Kor 1 12 2012, (2012); undefined; International Framework, (2013)",,Springer Nature,,21967075; 21967083,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130827956,

Introduction The lightly regulated global economy, catering to business corporations, financiers, and other entrepreneurs of the private sector, is increasingly home to another actor, but from the public realm. In recent decades, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have become a salient actor in the global marketplace, especially in the global South. SWFs are state-owned funds that invest financial assets to achieve governments’ macroeconomic objectives. Recent commentary on SWFs locates their global power and legitimacy largely within their adoption of Western investment models and market orthodoxy, rather than seeking to usurp it with a radically different economic agenda based on social justice or environmental sustainability. The success of SWFs in emerging economies such as those proliferating in the Gulf states and East Asia is similarly tied to their embrace of Western economic doctrines. SWFs’ growing presence in financial markets and resulting influence on economic development, coupled with their institutional status as public entities, make SWFs increasingly relevant to international environmental governance. While international environmental law has yet to discipline SWFs or be considered a material factor in their governance, some scrutiny of the environmental and social performance of SWFs is coming from the merging global movement for socially responsible investing (SRI), which seeks to align investing with social and environmental considerations. SRI, which is gaining momentum in a number of developing countries, is a phenomenon that draws attention to both the impacts of investing on the environment and the impacts of the environment on investing. The salience of these connections has been recognized by some SWFs, several of which have legal mandates to practice SRI. These include the Norwegian Government Pension Fund – Global, the French Pension Reserve Funds, and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. Several others, such as the Canada Pension Plan, have adopted policies to stimulate action in the realm of SRI. Many SWFs have also been established in developing countries, especially in the Gulf States and East Asia, with 40 percent of global SWFs’ assets from Asia and 35 per cent from the Middle East. With these trends, some observers envision SWFs bringing a greater public interest perspective to financial investing, including to further sustainable development. For now, this trend is most likely to arise with those Northern SWFs subject to SRI legal mandates. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Clark, Gordon L., Sovereign wealth funds: Legitimacy, governance, and global power, (2013); Shunmugam, Venkatachalam, Sovereign wealth funds and emerging economies - reap the good; leave the bad, Macroeconomics and Finance in Emerging Market Economies, 5, 2, pp. 281-296, (2012); Responsible Investment in Focus how Leading Public Pension Funds are Meeting the Challenge, (2007); OECD Emerging Markets Network Working Paper, (2008); Richardson, Benjamin J., Being virtuous and prosperous:Sris conflicting goals, Journal of Business Ethics, 92, SUPPL 1, pp. 21-39, (2010); In Between Two Societal Actors the Responsibilities of Swfs Towards Human Rights and Climate Change, (2012); Monk, Ashby H.B., Sovereignty in the era of global capitalism: The rise of sovereign wealth funds and the power of finance, Environment and Planning A, 43, 8, pp. 1813-1832, (2011); Beck, Roland, The impact of sovereign wealth funds on global financial markets, Intereconomics, 43, 6, pp. 349-358, (2008); Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems, (2010); Sovereign Wealth Funds the Need for Greater Transparency and Accountability, (2007)",,Cambridge University Press,,,9781107055698; 9781107295414,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954304859,

It argues that in order to understand the nature and potential of the range of new responses to climate change emerging at multiple scales we need to examine how governance is accomplished - how it is undertaken, practised and contested. Through a range of case studies drawn from communities, corporations and local government, the book examines how climate change comes to be governed and made to matter as an issue with which diverse publics should be concerned. It concludes that rather than seeking the solution to climate change once and for all, we need to engage with the ways in which we can channel our intentions to ameliorate the climate problem to more progressive ends.

By 'orchestrating' intermediaries - including NGOs - IOs can shape and steer global governance without engaging in hard, direct regulation. This volume is organized around a theoretical model that emphasizes voluntary collaboration and support. An outstanding group of scholars investigate the significance of orchestration across key issue areas, including trade, finance, environment and labor, and in leading organizations, including the GEF, G20, WTO, EU, Kimberley Process, UNEP and ILO. The empirical studies find that orchestration is pervasive. They broadly confirm the theoretical hypotheses while providing important new insights, especially that states often welcome IO orchestration as achieving governance without creating strong institutions.

Unlocking private capital at scale is essential to fill the current financing gap and achieve transformational impacts, but there are several barriers to overcome for this to happen. This study sought to analyze the role that national development banks (NDBs) could play to bridge the financing gap by scaling up private investment. Their knowledge and long-standing relationship with the local private sector places them in a privileged position to understand local barriers to investment as well as risks and opportunities. Drawing empirical evidence from NDBs’ experiences within the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) region, the study finds that while many NDBs are already piloting an array of financial and nonfinancial instruments to promote and leverage private low-carbon investments, these institutions are at diverse stages of “readiness” to fully promote climate-related programs. Several NDBs still need to build and/or strengthen capacity and acquire experience in the structuring, risk assessment, and monitoring of climate-relevant projects in order to take a more central role in the international climate finance landscape. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Finance; Latin America And The Caribbean; Low Carbon; National Development Banks; Private Finance,,,"undefined; Empresa Renovable, (2012); Public Development Banks Addressing the Challenges of Financing Climate Change Mitigation, (2012); Role of Bndes in Fostering Sustainable Development Power Point Presentation, (2012); undefined; Leveraging Private Investment the Role of Public Sector Climate Finance, (2011); Monitoring and Tracking Long Term Finance to Support Climate Action, (2011); Landscape of Climate Finance, (2014); Strategic Program for Climate Resilience St Lucia, (2011); Strategic Program for Climate Resilience Jamaica, (2012)",,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,,,9783642386695; 9783642386701,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944521199,

Forecasting expected losses of critical environmental functions, which underpin society, is setting new challenges insurance underwriters and scientists. A critique of recent case histories will be presented to illustrate the latest dimensions of future risk needs. International operators wrestle with the dollar value of reputational risks of uncharted frontier areas with sensitive marine ecosystems which affect both stakeholder confidence and the stock price. Governments now recognize the criticality of managing environmental capital and services when dealing with new energy concessions in sensitive coastal zones. International efforts to develop ""state of the art"" techniques to quantify the spectrum of ecosystem services will be presented together with a critique of how readily these can be factored into decision making. Advances in global geographic information systems and satellite imagery illustrate the unprecedented future opportunities to measure ecosystem functions and changes. A series of case histories will illustrate cutting edge approaches to dealing with oil spill risk for offshore assets revealing environmental resource risk exposure, risk reduction, consequences and future liabilities. The criteria used to determine ""environmental damage or loss"" are fundamental to our approaches to corporate risk management. Our understanding of the role of factors such as: biodiversity; ecosystem robustness; recoverability; habitat uniqueness; species population status and life cycles in the sustainability of ecosystem services will be reviewed and reveals fundamental gaps in knowledge. The global efforts being made to place $ values on the world's natural capital and ecosystem life support services will be summarised. A pioneering approach to due diligence of investments, planning, new concessions and oil spill risk assessments will be presented. Insights will be given on the latest techniques for mapping environmental resources and services in integrated GIS systems on the web, which will provide an ""ecosystem health thermometer"" making damage to ecosystem services visible to stakeholders.

This negligence today has led to huge losses in terms of climate change, biodiversity, environmental degradation, rising green house gases, loss of forests and water resources, and so forth. This degrading situation of the environment has led to a call by the society for taking responsibility to safeguard the planet. The corporates, thus have shifted their focus from the single bottom line, that is, profit to the wider approach of “triple bottom line” in lieu of achieving economic, social, and environmental performance simultaneously for attaining sustainable development. Today, every sector of the world economy is talking about their approach towards protection of the environment, and the financial sector moving towards their 'going green' approach in no exception. Various financial services which have adopted green approach in their businesses are banks, stock brokerages, insurance companies, and consumer finance companies.

A counter-argument is that beneficiaries' best interests can be interpreted more broadly to also encompass such concerns. We seek to contribute to resolving this controversy by measuring preferences for social responsible investment (SRI) among beneficiaries of pension funds. The data from a survey questionnaire answered by 1119 future beneficiaries of the Swedish pension system show that beneficiaries on average prefer their pension funds to go beyond financial concerns and engage in SRI. Analysing the determinants of the preferences, we find support for a model including both financial motives (beliefs about financial risk and returns) and values-based motives (self-transcendent value priorities). Our results give unique insights into the psychological drivers of beneficiaries' preferences that are highly pertinent to present attempts at rethinking the aims of pension investments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Beneficiaries; Fiduciary Duty; Pension Funds; Socially Responsible Investment; Values,,This research was financially supported by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra) through the Sustainable Investment Research Platform (SIRP) and by a grant from the Rotman International Centre for Pension Management.

The insurance sector's global influence and societal impact is fairly well documented. The sector influences societies based on its interaction with stakeholders, on its products, business and political stance. As such, it is a critical actor in facilitating key climate change actions of mitigation and adaptation, and has already been recognized as a leading sector in terms of climate adaptation. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of non-life insurers in fulfilling the climate commitments of the Kyoto Protocol. This paper is based on a case study on Nordic non-life insurance companies. The study documents that Nordic insurers are responding to climate-related threats and opportunities in a strategic manner by reducing their own impacts, through their core activities, and by influencing others to act. Although Nordic insurers do not classify their actions into mitigation and adaptation, but classify them according to their core activities, they demonstrate through actions their role as potential allies for nations in fulfilling the Kyoto protocol climate commitments. The study also reveals that the commercial reality of the industry is not the same as the expected contribution to climate commitments, for instance as specified in international conventions and treaties and in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and industry reports. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Climate Change; Insurance; Mitigation; Nordic; Policy,,,"Climate Change 2007 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2007); Nordic Innovation Publication, (2011); Stockholm the Commission on Climate Change and Development, (2008); Berkhout, Frans G.H., Learning to adapt: Organisational adaptation to climate change impacts, Climatic Change, 78, 1, pp. 135-156, (2006); Nordic Insurance Companies Meet the Challenge of Climate Change Statement from the Nordic Insurance Industry Adopted at the Nordic Insurers Climate Conference in Copenhagen 17th September 2009, (2009); Botzen, W.

The result is the proliferation of consumption of ""green"" products, eco-labels, consumer awareness campaigns, etc. This paper, however, argues that the dominant focus on green consumerism as against the need for structural changes towards a broader systemic shift is unrealistic. Furthermore, promoting green consumerism at once lays responsibility on consumers to undertake the function of maintaining economic growth while simultaneously, even if contradictorily, bearing the burden to drive the system towards sustainability. Given the scope of the sustainability challenge and the urgency with which it must be addressed, this paper argues that the consumer is not the most salient agent in the production-consumption system; expecting the consumer through green consumerism to shift society towards SCP patterns is consumer scapegoatism. This paper draws on the discursive confusion over discourse and practice of sustainable consumption. It attempts to clarify the differences between green consumerism and sustainable consumption, looking at each concept's historical development, its perspective on the consumer, and the main approaches to achieving sustainability. It then introduces the Attitudes-Facilitators- Infrastructure (AFI) framework - a framework for sustainable consumption policy design that goes beyond green consumerism, and that enables wellbeing and ecological sustainability without propagating the economic-growth dogma that has a stranglehold on contemporary policy-making. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the same way that these movements and ruptures express the transformative effects of new Internet technologies that came of age in the 1990s, so now does the emergent global climate justice movement of the 20-teens embody and express the transformative potential of emergent social media technologies that came of age in the 2000s. 1 Looking backwards from these decades of technology-driven histori-cal change, we now see clearly an equally profound continuity: Changing mass media have shaped every modern social movement, each in its own time and place. Each movement bears the mark of dawning communications and transportation technologies that were, in their time and place, transcending barriers to collective action and consequently reorganizing power-laden social relations. Where would the 19th-century abolition movement have gone without the Black Press that arguably began with the founding of Freedom’s Journal in 1827? 2 How would the Civil Rights Movement have unfolded absent the publication of those horrifi c photos of Emmit Till’s bludgeoned and river-bloated corpse in the September 15, 1955, issue of Jet Magazine? 3 The Montgomery bus boycott? 4 The news footage of viscous police dogs flashing teeth and chewing up peaceful kids at the Children’s Crusade in Birmingham 1963? The March on Washington? What impact did constant TV news footage from Vietnam have on the free speech and anti-war movements of the 1960s? Or consider the modern environmental movement absent those Apollo 17 “blue marble” photos of December 7, 1972. 5 We should also mention the media storm unleashed when Commander Marcos and the EZLN revolted in Chiapas on DAY 1 of the North American Free Trade Agreement: January 1, 1994. 6 What these examples show is how social movements really get moving when individuals are able to identify with each other through shared experience facilitated by images (especially visual but also narrative), reaching through media across every previous barrier of time and space to recognize the social and increasingly environmental conditions of their shared grievances. It might now seem cliché, but in 1999, when the Seattle anti-World Trade Organization protestors chanted down the police and National Guard with “The Whole World Is Watching! The Whole World Is Watching!” they were announcing the arrival of a new digital era in activism, protest, and resistance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Prisms, (1981); New Left Review, (1967); Negative Dialectics, (1973); Alexander, Jeffrey C., The Civil Sphere, pp. 1-814, (2012); Black Press Soldiers Without Swords, (1998); Amin, Samir, A Note on the Depreciation of the Future, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 3, 3, pp. 82-84, (1992); Critical Environmental Politics; Distinction A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, (1984); Calhoun, Craig Jackson, Imagining solidarity: Cosmopolitanism, constitutional patriotism, and the public sphere, Public Culture, 14, 1, pp. 147-171, (2002); Shallows What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains, (2010)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781134623372; 9780415709033,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086551501,

This framework is inherently anthropocentric, organizing ecological processes by their effects on human beneficiaries and explicitly connecting ecosystem processes to human welfare. The ecosystem services approach facilitates management of a complex system by incorporating important aspects of risk-informed management. Ecosystem services provide a framework for assessing the many stressors to and outputs of a river basin by organizing stakeholders, identifying those whose actions affect the provision of ecosystem services and those whose well-being will be impacted by changes in the provision of ecosystem services, and by delineating the mechanisms by which land-use changes affect stakeholders. The framework is best used to assess changes in ecosystem service delivery and can be useful for considering the trade-offs among services provided by a variety of plausible future land-use scenarios. Within the ecosystem services framework, stakeholder beneficiaries identify the ecosystem services they find valuable. Ecosystem service valuation is not necessarily monetary valuation, but using money as a common currency for comparison can aid decision-making. Economic valuation approaches have a number of problems and pitfalls, but when thoughtfully applied, they allow the possibility of payments for ecosystem services, which can be a useful tool when command-and-control regulation does not work or is politically infeasible. Overall, ecosystem services are a useful tool for river basin managers because they provide a coherent context to incorporate stakeholders and complex biophysical processes into a consistent, learning-based management scheme. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Common Language; Economic Valuation; Ecosystem Services; Hydrologic Services; Land-use Change; Payment; River Basin Management; Watershed,,,"Risk Informed Management of European River Basins, (2014); Ecology, (1935); Odum, Eugene P., The emergence of ecology as a new integrative discipline, Science, 195, 4284, pp. 1289-1293, (1977); Daily, Gretchen C., Value of nature and the nature of value, Science, 289, 5478, pp. 395-396, (2000); Ecosystems and Human Well Being A Framework for Assessment, (2003); New Economy of Nature the Quest to Make Conservation Profitable, (2002); Bolund, Per, Ecosystem services in urban areas, Ecological Economics, 29, 2, pp. 293-301, (1999); Corbera, Esteve, The equity and legitimacy of markets for ecosystem services, Development and Change, 38, 4, pp. 587-613, (2007); Atkinson, Giles D., Environmental cost-benefit analysis, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 33, pp. 317-344, (2008); Water Funds Protecting Watersheds for Nature and People, (2010)",,Springer Verlag,,1867979X,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988220880,

This Article examines ways in which public pension funds invest against the economic interests of their own participants and beneficiaries, and the legal implications of these investments. In particular, the Article focuses on the use of public pensions to fund privatization of public employee jobs. Under the ascendant—and flawed—interpretation of the fiduciary duty of loyalty, public pension trustees owe their allegiance to the fund itself, rather than to the fund’s participants and beneficiaries, notwithstanding the fact that the duty of loyalty commands trustees to invest “solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries” according to ERISA and similar state pension codes. I argue that this “fund-first” view distorts the duty of loyalty and turns the role of trustee on its head, leading to investments that undermine, rather than enhance, the economic interests of public employees. I turn to ERISA, trust law, agency law, and corporate law to argue that public pension trustees should consider the impact of the funds’ investments on the jobs and job security of the funds’ participants and beneficiaries, where relevant. I also adduce evidence that these controversial investments are widespread. I propose that public pension funds be governed by a “member-first” view of fiduciary duty focused on the economic interests of public employees in their retirement funds, which go beyond maximizing return to the funds. I argue that this view is more faithful to the original purpose of the duty of loyalty than is the fund-first view. I suggest ways to implement the member-first view, discuss potential extensions beyond the jobs impact of investments, and assess the proposed reform’s practical effects. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Bloomberg, (2012); Telephone Interview with Martin Z Braun Public Finance Reporter Bloomberg News, (2013); Mass State Ret Bd Benefit Guide for the Massachusetts State Employees Retirement System, (2013); Social Security Coverage; U S C, (2012); Sec Y of Health Educ Welfare V Snell, (1969); Wash Lee L Rev, (2013); undefined; Firestone Tire Rubber Co V Bruch, (1989); Legislative Enactment Status",,New York University Law Review,,00287881,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920077777,

Governance refers to the rules, incentives, institutions and philosophies for coordinating, controlling and supervising behaviour. The SRI sector purports to be a mechanism of market governance, such as through its codes of conduct and targeting of individual companies by engagement or divestment.Method/approach: This subject-matter of the chapter is evaluated primarily through a conceptual and theoretical argument rather than empirical research.Findings: Social investors' capacity to 'govern' the market is constrained by gaps and deficiencies in the legal frameworks for the financial economy. Fiduciary law controlling institutional investors is the most important element of this governance framework. The SRI movement is starting to broaden its agenda and strategies to include advocacy for regulatory reform. But the SRI industry has devoted attention to its own voluntary codes of conduct, such as the UNPRI, which do not yet provide a sufficiently comprehensive or robust substitute for official regulation.Social implications: Paradoxically, whereas SRI once stood for taking action through the financial economy when governments had failed to act, the sector is also somewhat dependent on the state to provide an empowering governance framework. But state regulation itself may be strengthened by partnership with the SRI industry, such as by utilising its codes of conduct to supplement official legal standards.Originality/value of the chapter: The chapter deepens insights into the relationship between the SRI sector as a largely voluntary movement and its legal governance through the state or the market. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fiduciary Law; Market Governance; Voluntary Codes,,,"Securities Regulation and Law Report, (2010); Responsive Regulation Transcending the Deregulation Debate, (1992); Balmer, John M.T., The BP deepwater Horizon débâcle and corporate brand exuberance, Journal of Brand Management, 18, 2, pp. 97-104, (2010); Tiny Steps Forward on the Outside Job Comments on the Equator Principles III Official First Draft, (2012); Response to Independent Commission on Banking Interim Report Consultation on Reform, (2011); Investor Briefing Note What Investors Need to Know about Reclamation Risks in the Oil Sands, (2010); Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector, (2009); Financial Post, (2011); Protecting Our Best Interests Rediscovering Fiduciary Obligation, (2011); Regulation Governance, (2008)",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

The main mechanisms have been the rapid pace of technological and social innovation, human capital accumulation, and the conversion of resources and natural capital into more valuable forms of produced capital. However, there is evidence emerging that this model may be approaching environmental limits and planetary boundaries, and that the conversion of natural capital needs to slow down rapidly and then be reversed. Some commentators have asserted that in order for this to occur, we will need to stop growing altogether and, instead, seek prosperity without growth. Others argue that environmental concerns are low-priority luxuries to be contemplated once global growth has properly returned to levels observed prior to the 2008 financial crisis. A third group argues that there is no trade-off, and, instead, promotes green growth: the (politically appealing) idea is that we can simultaneously grow and address our environmental problems. This paper provides a critical perspective on this debate and suggests that a substantial research agenda is required to come to grips with these challenges. One place to start is with the relevant metrics: measures of per-capita wealth, and, eventually, quantitative measures of prosperity, alongside a dashboard of other sustainability indicators. A public and political focus on wealth (a stock), and its annual changes, could realistically complement the current focus on market-based gross output as measured by GDP (a flow). This could have important policy implications, but deeper changes to governance and business models will be required. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Green Growth; Limits To Growth; Planetary Boundaries; Resilience; Sustainable Prosperity,,,"Acemoglu, Daron, Technical Change, Inequality, and the Labor Market, Journal of Economic Literature, 40, 1, pp. 7-72, (2002); Low Carbon Green Growth in Asia Policies and Practices, (2013); Allen, Myles R., Atmosphere: Call off the quest, Science, 318, 5850, pp. 582-583, (2007); Alvaredo, Facundo, The top 1 percent in international and historical perspective, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 27, 3, pp. 3-20, (2013); Arthur, W.

Two alternative and sharply contrasting theorizations, one collective and collaborative (the work of Berle and Means), the other individualistic and contractual (agency theory and shareholder value) are focused upon. The explanatory potential of Blair and Stout's team production theory is elaborated, and its conception of the complexity of business enterprise, with a mediating hierarch (the board of directors) securing a balance between the interests of different stakeholders. The potential for reform of corporate purpose, corporate governance and directors' duties is examined with reference to the UK Modern Company Law Review. The impact of the intensification of the financialization of corporations is analysed, with the increased emphasis upon short-termism. The origins of the global financial crisis in shareholder value orientations and the continuing reverberations of the crisis are explored.

The trading of emission certificates has become an important trade commodity worldwide, and its markets have diversified. While this opportunity has created new markets for entrepreneurs and actors that range from farmers to brokers, unequal involvement in most developing countries is noted. This has been mostly observed in those countries where entrepreneurship is often regarded as the cornerstone of economic growth and social improvement. South Africa has spearheaded other African countries in its implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects leading to carbon trading. Based on our research on South African entrepreneurship and its involvement in the carbon market, we conclude that albeit a number of opportunities, the biggest challenge for entrepreneurial participation in the carbon market remains in the nature and processes of CDM project implementation, the lack of a clear supportive system, limited access to financing and-more importantly-general ignorance of the trading opportunities by entrepreneurs. The complex nature of CDM projects themselves limits participation due to lack of the necessary skills on the national level leading to uneven distribution of CDM projects on provincial levels in South Africa. Recommendations are provided to overcome the obstacles and to promote entrepreneurial activity in the carbon market. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Market; Carbon Trading; Clean Development Mechanism; Entrepreneurship; Kyoto Protocol; South Africa; Climate Change; Developing Countries; Economics; Emission Control; Energy Policy; Carbon Markets; Carbon Trading; Clean Development Mechanism; Entrepreneurship; Kyoto Protocol; South Africa; Carbon,Climate change; Developing countries; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Carbon markets; Carbon trading; Clean Development Mechanism; Entrepreneurship; KYOTO protocol; South Africa; Carbon,,"Abzari, Mehdi, The role of culture on entrepreneurship development: Case study: Iran, International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management, 9, 4, pp. 135-154, (2009); Environmental Initiatives Airlines and Offsetting Schemes, (2011); Amit, Raphael, Why do venture capital firms exist? theory and canadian evidence, Journal of Business Venturing, 13, 6, pp. 441-466, (1998); Das Klein Und Mittelunternehmertum in Sudafrika Nach Dem Ende Der Apartheid Entstehung Und Entwicklungspotentiale Des Nichtweien Unternehmertums, (2005); Service Providers, (2011); Berger, Allen N., The economics of small business finance: The roles of private equity and debt markets in the financial growth cycle, Journal of Banking and Finance, 22, 6-8, pp. 613-673, (1998); Boehmer-Christiansen, Sonja A., Science, equity, and the war against carbon, Science Technology and Human Values, 28, 1, pp. 69-92, (2003); Green Certificate Trading, (2009); Climate Change Risks and Opportunities for the South African Economy Case Study Renewable Energy and the Draft Irp 2010, (2010); State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2009, (2008)",,Springer-Verlag London Ltd,,09515666; 14355655,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905021476,

To investigate whether such proposals are likely to generate the desired results, we conducted an evaluation of the screening process under the Australian government's EIA regime from its introduction on 16 July 2000 to 30 June 2013 (study period). Almost 1 in 5 'particular manner' decisions-a type of screening decision under the regime-were found to be unlawful. The extent of non-compliance is explained on the basis of convenience. The department was required to assess a large number of projects under tight timeframes and with limited resources, while being pressured by proponents to allow their projects to bypass EIA. These pressures resulted in the development of an informal custom whereby the formal compensatory mitigation restrictions were frequently ignored. The results highlight the relative significance of formal and informal institutions in EIA. Formal EIA rules typically provide a mere outline of the process. The informal institutions adopted by administrators often have a greater influence on how the process operates and what it achieves. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Administrative Discretion; Eia; Environmental Impact Assessment; Implementation Theory; Institutionalism; Screening; Environmental Impact; Screening; Administrative Discretion; Decision Makers; Eia; Environmental Impact Assessments (eia); Implementation Theory; Institutionalism; Non-compliance; Screening Process; Environmental Impact Assessments; Compensation System; Decision Making; Environmental Impact Assessment; Implementation Process; Institutional Reform; Temporal Period; Australia,Environmental impact; Screening; Administrative discretion; Decision makers; EIA; Environmental impact assessments (EIA); Implementation theory; Institutionalism; Non-compliance; Screening process; Environmental impact assessments; compensation system; decision making; environmental impact assessment; implementation process; institutional reform; temporal period; Australia,,"Australian Government Response to the Report of the Independent Review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, (2011); Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 Environmental Offsets Policy, (2012); Referrals Assessments and Approvals Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, (2003); Conservation and Protection of National Threatened Species and Ecological Communities Department of the Environment and Water Resources, (2007); Bartlett, Robert V., The theory of environmental impact assessment: Implicit models of policy making, Policy and Politics, 27, 4, pp. 415-433, (1999); Georgetown International Environmental Law Review, (2001); Bonyhady, Tim, Putting the environment first?, Environmental and Planning Law Journal, 29, 4, pp. 316-327, (2012); Policy Through Impact Assessment, (1989); National Environmental Policy Act an Agenda for the Future, (1998); Canter, Larry W., Impact significance determination-Basic considerations and a sequenced approach, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 13, 5, pp. 275-297, (1993)",,Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com,,01959255,9024727650; 9789024727650,EIARD,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903590549,

As a result, public and private initiatives for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have been widely endorsed by policy-makers. A key issue is the feasibility of carbon trading or other incentives to encourage land-owners and indigenous people, particularly in developing tropical countries, to conserve forests, rather than to cut them down for agricultural or other development purposes. This book presents a major critique of the aims and policies of REDD as currently structured, particularly in terms of their social feasibility. It is shown how the claims to be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as enhance people's livelihoods and biodiversity conservation are unrealistic. There is a naive assumption that technical or economic fixes are sufficient for success. However, the social and governance aspects of REDD, and its enhanced version known as REDD+, are shown to be implausible. Instead to enhance REDD's prospects, the author provides a roadmap for developing a new social contract that puts people first. © 2013 Michael I. Brown.

The aim of this research is to investigate how regulatory changes and contractual solutions can help solve the landlord/tenant dilemma in relation to sustainable renovation of residential buildings, and how the general awareness of sustainable renovation can be increased. Particular focus is on whether tools like energy performance contracting and energy labeling can help solve the landlord/tenant dilemma. The research was done in relation to the specific situation in Denmark, but theory, information and experiences from other countries were included. The results show that there are plenty of opportunities to overcome the landlord/tenant dilemma, but principal/agent problems can only be overcome with a package solution. In the Danish national context the package solution must consist of legislative changes, financial incentives and better dissemination of information. Therefore, an array of different tools must be integrated and used in cooperation to overcome the dilemma. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Landlord/tenant Dilemma; Residential Buildings; Sustainable Renovation; Energy Labeling; Energy Performance Contracting; Financial Incentives; Landlord/tenant Dilemma; Legislative Changes; Regulatory Change; Residential Building; Sustainable Renovation; Labels; Tools; Buildings; Electricity Generation; Energy Efficiency; Energy Use; Household Energy; Landowner; Residential Energy; Residential Location; Sustainability; Denmark,Energy labeling; Energy performance contracting; Financial incentives; Landlord/tenant dilemma; Legislative changes; Regulatory change; Residential building; Sustainable renovation; Labels; Tools; Buildings; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy use; household energy; landowner; residential energy; residential location; sustainability; Denmark,,"undefined, (2011); undefined, (2011); Liberating the Power of Energy Services and Escos in A Liberalised Energy Market, (2006); European Commission Dg Joint Research Centre Institute for Energy, (2010); Bygherreforeningen Og Grundejernes Investeringsfond, (2011); Encyclopedia of Energy, (2004); An Australian Perspective Master Thesis Queensland University of Technology, (2011); Fra Paradox Til Potential Ved Energirenovering Af Private Udlejningsejendomme, (2011); undefined, (2012); undefined, (2010)",,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887191693,

The aim of this study is to shed some light on market rent and price premiums as perceived by professional operators in Italy. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of two cohorts of real estate stakeholders, either members of the Green Building Council Italia or commercial real estate investors, was carried out by means of an online questionnaire. Findings: Based on 270 responses, it can be inferred that, while the importance of green building is widely acknowledged, caution is still prevalent regarding expected gains. In fact, the majority of respondents perceive the increase in rent and price premiums as being equivalent to additional costs.

Our results indicate that: (1) incremental to information provided by current Toxics Releases Inventory (TRI) data, voluntary environmental disclosures provide valuation relevant information; (2) the various disclosure categories are similar in value relevance, implying that each category is informative of management's current environmental strategies; (3) current TRI is positively associated with cost of capital but there is no association between voluntary environmental disclosures and cost of capital; and (4) taken together, the above results point to a signaling role for such disclosures and financial performance prediction as the means by which voluntary environmental disclosures enhance firm value. This advances the literature by pinning down the source of firm value enhancement of such disclosures. Our results suggest that a proactive environmental strategy and the signaling of such a strategy to investors can enhance a firm's stock price, a finding which will assist CSR practitioners in convincing top management that proactive environmental strategies combined with transparent voluntary environmental disclosures are worthwhile. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,"We thank the Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, and SSHRC for the financial support of this project.

In the context of developing countries, such transition challenges are complex. - as faster economic growth along with universal access to energy are to be achieved aided by a low carbon energy system. Literature suggests that for this to happen there is need for rapid penetration of a variety of low carbon technology options supported by appropriately designed fiscal instruments. This paper reviews a wide variety of existing literature and draws example covering both Annex I and Non Annex I countries, with special emphasis on the latter, and shows how efficient and effective fiscal instruments are emerging for a transition to low carbon energy systems. Case study assessments show that initially incentives and strategies are built through national government's policy interventions to mobilize domestic finance to support the low carbon niche development which then attract private and public funds to promote and sustain the transition.

More importantly, a number of social and economic problems have developed and must be dealt with, in some cases urgently. Contaminated land laws and regulations have been established and have evolved in the US and UK and many other jurisdictions over the past few decades. These regimes have substantially influenced the relevant legislation in the context of numerous Asian and European countries and will inevitably benefit similar legislative efforts in China.

Corporate sustainability, which helps firms and outside stakeholders monitor the impacts of business operations, has emerged as a framework for engagement with industry on its nonproliferation responsibilities. However, the existing literature has not considered how to integrate nonproliferation into the current infrastructure of corporate sustainability, particularly into voluntary reporting standards or socially responsible investment analysis. These tools are essential market mechanisms that incentivize superior behavior on other challenges such as environmentally responsible management, respect for human rights, and fair labor practices. The authors outline the history of corporate sustainability and argue that nonproliferation should be considered a sustainability issue. They propose a nonproliferation pledge and a series of nonproliferation indicators as potential first steps that could build awareness and distinguish between firms based on how successful they are at meeting nonproliferation goals. © The Author(s) 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Sustainability; Dual-use; Export Control; Nonproliferation,,This work was supported under Prime Contract Number DE-AC05-76RL01830 for the US Department of Energy.,"Economic Impact of Nuclear Terrorist Attacks on Freight Transport Systems in an Age of Seaport Vulnerability, (2003); Aa1000 Accountability Principles Standard 2008, (2008); Peddling Peril how the Secret Nuclear Trade Arms Americas Enemies, (2010); Building A Corporate Nonproliferation Ethic, (1993); Values Charter, (2012); Demystifying Responsible Investment Performance, (2007); Australia Group Common Control Lists, (2007); Proliferation Financing Report, (2008); Sustainable Investing Establishing Long Term Value and Performance, (2012); Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, (2006)",,,,00963402; 19383282,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879403759,

This chapter identifies the political, economic, and social conditions that encourage companies to participate in public-private voluntary initiatives and assesses their effectiveness in contributing to the goals of the sponsoring organization. Political factors such as a democratic regime in the company's home country or the mobilization of countervailing interests such as environmental or labor groups provide incentives for business participation in these initiatives. Other factors, such as nationally distinct types of capitalism and the sponsoring organization's strategies for mobilizing participation are also discussed. While companies' decisions to join voluntary codes are driven by concerns for the ""bottom line,"" participation seems to have small but beneficial effects in the areas addressed by voluntary codes.

The author therefore takes a critical look at how climate governance is reframed as an economic and investment challenge in recent years, and reveals some of the blind spots of focusing on the economic and investment opportunities related to climate protection. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Post Autistic Economics Review, (2004); Debating Climate Economics the Stern Review Vs Its Critics, (2007); Financing the Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Measures in Developing Countries, (2009); Report of the Secretary Generals High Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing, (2010); Andrew, Jane, Carbon tax: Challenging neoliberal solutions to climate change, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 21, 7, pp. 611-618, (2010); Arrow, Kenneth J., Global climate change: A challenge to policy, Economists' Voice, 4, 3, pp. 1-5, (2007); Bilateral Finance Institutions and Climate Change A Mapping of Climate Portfolios, (2009); Bäckstrand, Karin, Planting trees to mitigate climate change: Contested discourses of ecological modernization, green governmentality and civic environmentalism, Global Environmental Politics, 6, 1, pp. 50-75, (2006); Bailey, Ian G., Scales and networks of neoliberal climate governance: The regulatory and territorial logics of European Union emissions trading, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 34, 4, pp. 445-461, (2009); Promoting Economic Recovery Through Climate Legislation Mc Kinsey, (2009)",,Springer Fachmedien,,,9783658024055; 3658024054; 9783658024062,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933522639,

Led by an international collaboration of representatives from companies, financial institutions, governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP) of the market-oriented Forest Trends group, has created a global framework through which principles and standards for biodiversity offsets are being established. These enable the apparently unavoidable harm caused by development to be exchanged for investment in conservation activities both at different geographical locations and in the future. Offsets can also be traded via bespoke markets for environmental conservation indicators. Given a globalizing ‘green economy’ discourse that conservation can be a profitable enterprise if guided by market-based mechanisms and the entwining of ecological with economic spheres, biodiversity offsets are becoming key to current entrepreneurial interest in biodiversity conservation. The ‘green rush’ of my title refers to both this interest in conservation activities that can be marketized, and to an associated appetite in business and financial sectors for incorporating biodiversity offsets as part of a strategy for ‘greening’ the environmental harm caused by developments. I illustrate the uses to which biodiversity offsets are being put, through a case study connecting the extraction of uranium in Namibia for the generation of nuclear power in the UK. Biodiversity offsets are invoked to satisfy requirements for off-site mitigation of environmental harm at points of both extraction and ‘consumption’ of uranium in this case. I highlight some of the (anti-)ecological assumptions guiding calculations of complex ecological assemblages so that they can become biodiversity offsets, and draw attention to the intensified distributions of new environmental values with which biodiversity offsets may be associated. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Areva; Areva; Barbastelle Bats; Biodiversity Offsets; Business And Biodiversity Offsets Programme (bbop); Calculative Technologies; Compensaciones Para La Biodivers-idad; Crecimiento Verde; Electricité De France Energy (edf); Electricité De France Energy (edf); Energía Nuclear; Green Growth; Hinkley Point (reino Unido); Hinkley Point (uk); Murciélago Barbastelle; Namibia; Namibia; Nuclear Power; Programa De Negocios Y Compensaciones Para La Biodiversidad; Tecnologías De Cálculo; Uranio; Uranium,,,"Business 2010, (2008); Mining Areva and Namibia Strengthen their Strategic Partnership, (2009); Arsel, Murat, Nature™ Inc: Changes and Continuities in Neoliberal Conservation and Market-based Environmental Policy, Development and Change, 43, 1, pp. 53-78, (2012); Etango Project Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Esia, (2012); Bennett, Karen A., Additionality: The next step for ecosystem service markets, Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum, 20, 2, pp. 417-438, (2010); Welwitschia, (1978); Briggs, Brian D.J., Habitat banking-how it could work in the UK, Journal for Nature Conservation, 17, 2, pp. 112-122, (2009); Nature Unbound Conservation Capitalism and the Future of Protected Areas, (2008); Proposed Biodiversity Offsetting for Barbastelle Bats Hinkley Site Preparation Works, (2011); Biodiversity Offset Design Handbook, (2012)",,SAGE Publications Inc.,,19427786; 2633674X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84912036767,

Patterns of capital allocation shape the choices governments, companies, and consumers make, and thereby greatly influence the environmental consequences of economic life. This chapter provides an overview of key institutions and actors mediating the relationship between global finance and the environment. It observes that international rules for environmental accounting and disclosure remain too weak to provide sufficient information to investors on the environmental risks and impacts of corporate activities. It reviews the practices of a set of investors with long time horizons - pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, project finance banks, and export credit agencies - and identifies several tensions between their investment mandates, strategies, and environmental commitments. In conclusion, it argues that easing these tensions requires broader institutional changes that create a more supportive policy and regulatory context for environmental investing.

It examines the changing preferences of consumers for nature-friendly products and services, and offers examples of how companies are responding. The book also describes recent initiatives to enable businesses to measure, value and report their impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystem services.This book is a product of the TEEB study (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity). It provides important evidence of growing corporate concern about biodiversity loss and offers examples of how leading companies are taking action to conserve biodiversity and to restore ecosystems.The authors review a range of practical tools to manage biodiversity risks in business, with examples of how companies are using these tools to reduce costs, protect their brands and deliver real business value. The book also explores the emergence of new business models that deliver biodiversity benefits and ecosystem services on a commercial basis, the policy enabling frameworks needed to stimulate investment and entrepreneurship to realize such opportunities, and the obstacles that must be overcome.The book further examines how businesses can align their actions in relation to biodiversity and ecosystem services with other corporate responsibility initiatives, including community engagement and poverty reduction. Finally, the book concludes with a summary and recommendations for action. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Ecosystem Challenges and Business Implications, (2006); Building Biodiversity Business, (2008); Ten Years of Ethical Consumerism 19992008, (2008); Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid, How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami?, Current Biology, 15, 12, pp. R443-R447, (2005); National Gpp Policies and Guidelines, (2009); State of Biodiversity Markets Report Offset and Compensation Programs Worldwide, (2010); Facts and Figures on Fsc Growth and Markets Info Pack, (2008); Climate Change Scenarios for the Uk Scientific Report, (1998); World Energy Outlook, (2009); From 1st2nd Biofuel Generation Technologies, (2008)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9.7802E+12,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84916945036,

Furthermore it presents the main findings of this literature focusing specifically on possible future economic consequences of climate change in the Mediterranean area emphasizing the new knowledge in this field brought by the CIRCE project. The robust finding of the literature points out a low economic vulnerability of Euro-Mediterranean countries (with losses ranging from −0.25 to −1.4% of GDP for extreme temperature scenarios or even slight gains), and a higher vulnerability of North African and Eastern-Mediterranean countries (of roughly 2% of GDP by the mid of the century). Against this background the CIRCE project proposes one of the first attempts to perform a detailed integrated impact assessment exercise focusing on the Mediterranean area. With the IPCC A1B SRES scenario as ­reference, impacts related to energy demand, sea-level rise and tourism, have been economically assessed by a general equilibrium model. The Mediterranean as a whole loses 1.2% of GDP with the Northern-Mediterranean countries clearly less ­vulnerable than the Southern-Mediterranean ones. Among the former the average loss in 2050 is 0.5% of GDP, while among the latter this more than doubles. Particularly adversely affected are Cyprus, Albania and the Eastern Mediterranean region (−1.6, −2.4, −1.5% of GDP respectively in 2050). In terms of impact types, tourism and sea-level rise are clearly the most threatening, while GDP impacts induced by demand re-composition of energy use is less of an issue and often positive. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bottom Up Approaches; Climate Change; Economic Impacts And Modeling; Integrated Impact Assessment; Top-down,,,"Revision of Emission Scenarios on the Basis of Climate Change Impacts, (2010); A Macroeconomic Assessment of Impacts and Adaptation to Climate Change in Europe, (2009); Climate Change Impacts in Europe Final Report of the Peseta Research Project, (2009); Amelung, Bas, Implications of global climate change for tourism flows and seasonality, Journal of Travel Research, 45, 3, pp. 285-296, (2007); Financial Risks of Climate Change, (2009); Climchalp Project Report, (2007); Impact of Climate Change on Domestic and International Tourism A Simulation Study, (2005); A Global Database of Domestic and International Tourist Numbers at National and Subnational Level, (2004); Energy Demand and Temperature A Dynamic Panel Analysis, (2006); Bigano, Andrea, Predicting tourism flows under climate change: An editorial comment on Gössling and Hall (2006), Climatic Change, 79, 3-4, pp. 175-180, (2006)",,Springer International Publishing,,15740919; 22151621,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84912047444,

This paper considers attempts at justifying such engagement stemming from a range of (re-)interpretations of the fiduciary duties owed by pension funds to their beneficiaries, and thereby develops a hypothesis concerning the most effective political or legal remedy. Research Findings: Previous commentary suggests that fiduciary duty either already mandates SRI for pension funds, or at least can be made to do so rather easily. In contrast with this, however, this paper finds that none of the considered interpretations is able to justify engagement on social and environmental issues across the board. Indeed, the problem to some extent seems rooted in the very concept of fiduciary duty. Theoretical Implications: The paper is relevant to current attempts at justifying SRI through reinterpretations of fiduciary duty, provided mainly by legal scholars and practitioners. By addressing the more philosophical issue of how far the concept of fiduciary duty can be ""stretched"" to accommodate SRI (a project of conceptual rather than legal clarification), it provides an evaluation of the contemporary debate which is independent of squabbles about existing law. Policy Implications: The paper shows that there are conceptual limits to attempts at redefining fiduciary duty. But this does not mean that pension funds' engagement in SRI is unjustified or unjustifiable more generally. A more promising way to legally mandate SRI may be through what is dubbed independent social and environmental obligations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Governance; Institutional Shareholder; Legal Origins And Control; Ownership Mechanisms; Pension Fund Ownership,,,"Journal of Investing, (2005); Socially Responsible Investing Making A Difference and Making Money, (2001); undefined, (2009); European Sri Study, (2010); Freeman, R.

First, the paradigm shift of the Cancun Agreements is examined from an historical perspective and it is shown that the impasse in the negotiations, caused by the underlying over-emphasis on burden sharing reductions in emissions, can be overcome. Second, using information from two modelling exercises, it is demonstrated how climate finance can encourage the decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and thereby help align the development pattern with global climate goals. Third, a framework to place carbon finance within current discussions is sketched regarding both the reformation of the world financial systems and the facilitation of a sustainable economic recovery that is beneficial for North and South while addressing the low-carbon transition. It is concluded that upgrading climate finance is the key to triggering the shift to a low-carbon society and a system is proposed in which an agreed social cost of carbon is used to support the establishment of carbon emissions certificates to reorient a significant portion of global savings towards low-carbon investments. Policy relevance Investments that align development and climate objectives are shown to substantially lower the social cost of carbon and deliver long-term carbon emissions reductions. These reductions are greater than those contributed by the sole carbon price signal generated by a world cap-and-trade system. Carbon finance, as a part of the broader reform of financial systems and overseas aid, can help overcome the dual adversity of climate and financial crisis contexts. The carbon certificate, with an upfront agreed social cost of carbon, can be used as its instrument. The portion of the banking system that intends to reorient a significant part of world savings towards low-carbon investments could thus issue such carbon certificates. By giving carbon assets the status of a reserve currency, the system could even respond to the need of emerging countries to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and trigger a wave of worldwide sustainable growth through infrastructure markets. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cancun Agreements; Climate Change Negotiations; Climate Finance; Low-carbon Transition; Social Cost Of Carbon; Sustainable Development; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Emission Control; Financial Crisis; Financial System; Global Climate; Kyoto Protocol; Paradigm Shift; Sustainable Development,carbon emission; climate change; emission control; financial crisis; financial system; global climate; Kyoto Protocol; paradigm shift; sustainable development,,"Global Warming in an Unequal World A Case of Environmental Colonialism, (1991); Report of the Secretary General S High Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing, (2010); La Finance Durable Une Nouvelle Finance Pour Le Xxie Siecle, (2011); Aldy, Joseph E., Architectures for agreement: Addressing global climate change in the post–kyoto world, pp. 1-380, (2007); International Environmental Agreements Politics Law and Economics, (2003); National Interest, (2001); Beyond Kyoto Advancing the International Effort Against Climate Change, (2003); Financing the Response to Climate Change, (2010); Chakravarty, Shoibal, Sharing global CO2 emission reductions among one billion high emitters, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106, 29, pp. 11884-11888, (2009); Model Documentation for the Minicam Climate Change Science Program Stabilization Scenarios Ccsp Product 2 1a, (2007)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at,,17527457; 14693062,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873278693,

No longer can there be any doubt that anthropogenic (humancaused) warming of the Earth is happening, caused mainly by greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels. Climate change poses a grave threat to humankind. The world is already experiencing the consequences of global warming: more frequent and prolonged droughts, increasingly severe and more frequent storms, rising sea levels worldwide threatening coastal and vulnerable island populations, the melting of mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets, increased intensity of tropical cyclones and hurricanes, and more frequent and widespread fires. Without immediate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, climate change can only get worse. In the period since the issue of global warming was brought to the attention of the general public in the late 1980s, both the legislative and the executive branches of the United States government have launched a number of initiatives to assess the threat and formulate policies to address it. Nevertheless, two decades later the United States government has failed to take effective measures to address climate change domestically or to assert international leadership on achieving meaningful carbon emission reductions. It is now well-documented that a shift in public opinion and failure of political will on climate change took place at the turn of the millennium, a change which can be largely attributed to a sophisticated, nationwide public relations campaign designed to conceal the dangers of burning fossil fuels from the American public by deceiving it as to the true state of climate science. Yet this deception is arguably punishable as criminal fraud under several United States statutes: first, as defrauding the public under the generic mail/wire fraud statute; and second, as defrauding the United States government under the ""conspiracy to defraud the United States "" statute. This Article examines whether it can be regarded as a crime based not just upon the unethical motives of its perpetrators, but on its effects: the catastrophic, global devastation which is the likely outcome of its success.

Carbon footprints are useful for raising local awareness of the climate implications of the goods and services that residents choose to consume. They further highlight the impacts of local traffic and industry beyond traditional concerns related to the health effects of air pollution. Door-to-door interviews and inventories allowed for the calculation of residential, commercial and traffic contributions to Tara Road's carbon footprint. By and large, participants were enthusiastic about the research and the opportunity to contribute to an understanding of a globally important issue. No data from the local oil refinery were provided despite repeated verbal and written requests to management. Although only a partial footprint could be calculated, the results allowed for an assessment of the direct contributions of residents to local emissions and highlighted their indirect role as consumers and citizens in the drive to limit greenhouse gas emissions at a larger scale. These roles rely upon the availability of relevant and trustworthy information, and we discuss the implications for scientific research and community engagement on politically and economically sensitive issues in the context of state protection of pollutive industries and a national drive to limit public rights to sensitive information. © 2012 Society of South African Geographers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Access To Information; Carbon Calculators; Climate Change; Environmental Citizenship; Atmospheric Pollution; Carbon Emission; Citizenship; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gas; Health Impact; Neighborhood; Pollution Effect; Traffic Emission; Durban; Kwazulu-natal; South Africa,atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; citizenship; climate change; greenhouse gas; health impact; neighborhood; pollution effect; traffic emission; Durban; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa,,"Towards A Low Carbon City Focus on Durban, (2011); Information Disclosure Strategies for Green Industries, (2011); Rates Calculator, (2012); Environmental Law Reporter, (2001); Ghg Emission Factors for Waste Components Produced Treated and Recovered in the Hsy Area Background Document for the Calculations Annexure 1, (2011); White Paper on the National Climate Change Response, (2011); National Inventory Report Compiled Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Unfccc, (2009); Guidelines to Defra S Ghg Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, (2007); Virginia Environmental Law Journal, (2008); Sustainable Energy Briefing 22 BHP Billiton Oil and Eskom Revenue, (2010)",,,,21512418; 03736245,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871208485,

Method: Road-safety effects of various measures targeting environmental problems of road transportation and environmental effects of various road-safety measures were reviewed. Results: The results showed that a vast majority of the examined measures support both policy objectives and thereby contribute effectively to sustainable transportation. However, there were also measures with conflicting effects, although the number of those measures was limited. In addition, there were a number of measures with no interaction. Furthermore, many potential effects were not documented and therefore in many instances only likely effects were noted. Conclusion: There are two practical implications of this study. First, those measures that result in double benefits should be encouraged to be implemented. Second, in case of conflicting measures, the specific implementations should attempt to minimize the negative effects. © 2012 The Author(s). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environment; Measures; Road Transportation; Safety; Accident Prevention; Civil Defense; Roads And Streets; Sustainable Development; Environment; Environmental Problems; Measures; Policy Objectives; Potential Effects; Road Safety Measure; Road Transportation; Sustainable Transportation; Motor Transportation,Accident prevention; Civil defense; Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Environment; Environmental problems; Measures; Policy objectives; Potential effects; Road safety measure; Road transportation; Sustainable transportation; Motor transportation,,"Ahn, Kyoungho, A field evaluation case study of the environmental and energy impacts of traffic calming, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 14, 6, pp. 411-424, (2009); Andre, Michel, Driving speeds in Europe for pollutant emissions estimation, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 5, 5, pp. 321-335, (2000); Abare Research Report 09 17 Canberra, (2009); Baldasano, Jose M., Air pollution impacts of speed limitation measures in large cities: The need for improving traffic data in a metropolitan area, Atmospheric Environment, 44, 25, pp. 2997-3006, (2010); Beck, Laurie F., Motor vehicle crash injury rates by mode of travel, United States: Using exposure-based methods to quantify differences, American Journal of Epidemiology, 166, 2, pp. 212-218, (2007); Dansk Vejtidsskrift, (1992); Broughton, Jeremy, The benefits of improved car secondary safety, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 35, 4, pp. 527-535, (2003); Bunn, Frances, Area-wide traffic calming for preventing traffic related injuries, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 4, (2009); Carslaw, David C., Comprehensive analysis of the carbon impacts of vehicle intelligent speed control, Atmospheric Environment, 44, 23, pp. 2674-2680, (2010); Chen, Chialin, Exploring the relationship between vehicle safety and fuel efficiency in automotive design, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 15, 2, pp. 112-116, (2010)",,Springer Verlag,,18668887; 18670717,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869202554,

The purpose of this research was to examine the safeguarding of the natural environment, or environmental sustainability (ES), in sport by studying the level of environmentally responsible actions for ski resorts in the USA. Specifically, this manuscript focused on the USA ski industry and examined Ski Resorts Environmental Communications (SRECs) stated on each of 82 resort websites. The methods included rating these communications for their prominence, breadth and depth based on the environmental categories in the USA Sustainable Slopes Program (SSP) Charter. Based on both these SREC ratings and the grades assigned to each resort by the Ski Area Citizen's Coalition (SACC), the resorts were classified as inactive, exploitive, reactive, or proactive using an adaption of Hudson and Miller's (2005) model. The results provide an assessment of the level of environmentally responsible actions by the ski resorts. Several directions for future research have been brought forward from this study, including the need to examine motivations behind ski resort publications on environmental communications and the likelihood of skiers selecting resorts based on the environmental communications posted on websites. A concentration of research is needed to develop further understandings concerning the contemporary issue of ES in sport. © 2012 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Behavior; Environmental Profiles Of Ski Resorts; Environmental Strategies,,,"Aerts, Walter, Media legitimacy and corporate environmental communication, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 34, 1, pp. 1-27, (2009); Martínez de Anguita, Pablo, Environmental economic, political and ethical integration in a common decision-making framework, Journal of Environmental Management, 88, 1, pp. 154-164, (2008); undefined, (2012); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Building the future by looking to the past: Examining research published on organizations and environment, Organization and Environment, 19, 4, pp. 458-478, (2006); Becken, Susanne, Tourists' perception of international air travel's impact on the global climate and potential climate change policies, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 15, 4, pp. 351-368, (2007); Environment, (2011); 5th World Congress on Sport and Environment, (2003); Burningham, Kate, Being constructive: Social constructionism and the environment, Sociology, 33, 2, pp. 297-316, (1999); Carroll, Archie B., A Commentary and an Overview of Key Questions on Corporate Social Performance Measurement, Business and Society, 39, 4, pp. 466-478, (2000); undefined, (2012)",,,,14413523,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865863482,

In all markets, but particularly in emerging markets, these indices can also contribute to stimulate responsible practices in companies that want to be part of the index and those that are already members. Furthermore, they can contribute to the deepening of the capital markets, not only by serving as a benchmark, but also by developing interest in responsible investment on the part of foreign and domestic institutional investors. To play these roles, the admission, selection and removal process of companies into sustainability indices must have particular characteristics. For example, there should be a relatively large stock of eligible companies. Furthermore, the investment environment in the capital markets must also be relatively developed for investors to appreciate the long-term value of responsible companies and analysts must have the right incentives to promote responsible investments. Under certain conditions, the indices can also help to attract foreign capital, seeking international diversification, to the local capital markets. Even though there are more than 50 general and specialized sustainability indices, there are only seven associated with stock exchanges in developing countries: South Africa, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, China, India, Turkey and Mexico. This study analyses the conditions that make for effective sustainability indices in promoting capital market development and responsible practices and the impacts that corporations and investors can expect.

Currently, risky levels of private and public debts coexist with vast amounts of savings that ""do not know where to go."" Long-term climate-oriented financial products could enhance investors' confidence in low-carbon projects (LCP) and channel to them large amounts of private savings. The paper outlines a financial architecture, the cornerstone of which is an agreement on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) integrated into a project's appraisal and acting as a surrogate for a carbon price. This SCC would be the value of carbon certificates issued by the government and delivered to banks to issue credit facilities reducing the risk-adjusted costs of LCPs. These carbon certificates could be gradually transformed into legal reserve assets of the banks after verification of the reality of the projects. Finally, the paper considers whether such certificates would be recognized as genuine international reserve assets, backed by the rising value of carbon over time. It shows how emerging countries could then diversify their foreign exchange reserves through an asset based on the international recognition of climate as a global public good. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Certificates; Climate Agreement; Climate Finance; Monetary Policy; Social Cost Of Carbon; Certification; Climate Change; Debt; Environmental Economics; Investment; Monetary Policy; Public Goods; Risk Assessment; Savings,certification; climate change; debt; environmental economics; investment; monetary policy; public goods; risk assessment; savings,,"Report of the Secretary General S High Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing, (2010); La Finance Durable Une Nouvelle Finance Pour Le Xxie Siecle, (2011); Aldy, Joseph E., Architectures for agreement: Addressing global climate change in the post–kyoto world, pp. 1-380, (2007); Aldy, Joseph E., Thirteen plus one: A comparison of global climate policy architectures, Climate Policy, 3, 4, pp. 373-397, (2003); Financing the Response to Climate Change, (2010); Scaling Up the Financing of Emissions Reduction Projects for Low Carbon Development in Developing Countries Proposal for A Low Carbon Development Facility Lcdf, (2010); Recipe the Economics of Decarbonization Synthesis Report, (2009); Twenty First Century Macroeconomics Responding to the Climate Challenge, (2009); Le Commerce Des Promesses, (2001); Meeting the Climate Challenge Using Public Funds to Leverage Private Investment in Developing Countries, (2009)",,,,15679764; 15731553,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859577677,

The paper explains how difficult it is within the structure and content of conventional leases to reduce the environmental impact of the tenanted commercial built environment. It explores the interplay between the content and structure of commercial leases and the behaviour of building owners, managers, tenants and occupants, illustrated through the experiences of a large Australian-based commercial office building owner/operator. With reference to practical examples it shows how conventional leases stifle innovation and illustrates the difficulties in drafting leases that enable a responsive approach to building management to be adopted. It shows how more fundamental changes that align and reward owners and tenants for working together for mutual benefit are required. The paper presents a number of “model clauses” for encouraging best environmental practices and concludes with a suite of recommendations. Although there have been conversations about green leases in recent years, there is little detailed evidence of their use in the marketplace. This paper remedies that deficiency by taking a case study approach that: illustrates the opportunities and difficulties in negotiating green leases; and shows how attempts to provide innovative building management can be hindered or supported by lease terms. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Australia; Commercial Leases; Commercial Property; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Performance; Green Leases; Leasehold Innovation; Leasing; Thermal Comfort,,,"Second Plank Update A Review of the Contribution that Energy Efficiency in the Buildings Sector can Make to Greenhouse Gas Emissions Abatement, (2010); Greening Uk Cities Buildings, (2008); ANSI ASHRAE Standard 55 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, (2010); Energy Efficiency in Government Operations, (2010); Green Lease Schedule Guidance Notes, (2011); Green Lease Toolkit, (2009); Carbon Reduction Commitment A Guide for Landlords and Tenants, (2009); Conveyancer, (2008); Conveyancer, (2010); Uk Climate Change Programme Potential Evolution for Business and the Public Sector, (2005)",,,,17561469; 17561450,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986031690,

Design/methodology/approach: A summative content analysis is used to identify major research areas and industrial branches in the sustainability literature relevant to retail supply chains, and sustainability considerations in retail practice. Findings: Sustainability-related issues have been discussed for many years and the term sustainability has received increased attention in research since the mid-1990s. In retail research, there seems to be a time lag of more than ten years in using the term sustainability compared to other fields in research and industry. However, some of these other research fields and industries have an impact on retail supply chains. At the same time, it seems that sustainability has received more attention in retail management practice compared to research applications. Research limitations/implications: Future retail research should try to integrate the findings from related research areas and industry sectors, and emerging issues in practice magazines. Originality/value: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of past and current sustainability research in retailing and sustainability relevance in retail practice.

Research on investor-driven governance networks and shareholder activism as a social movement illuminates strategies for organized shareholder coalitions to use a coordinated resolution filing campaign to shape the rules and norms under which business operates. These strategies are examined through qualitative case study analysis of two environmental shareholder campaigns: one organized by Ceres (Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies) addressing climate change and the other organized by Investor Environmental Health Network (IEHN) addressing hydraulic fracturing. These case studies show that resolution filing with broad investor appeal and linked to a policy agenda can achieve change beyond targeted companies. Case study insights may contribute to the formation of a Canadian shareholder coalition organized around improved corporate disclosure of Oil Sands risks and improved government monitoring of environmental impacts. Investor groups, mostly Canadian, have framed the environmental and social issues in terms that resonate with the investment community and policy makers. Investor activists in Canada, the US and Europe have filed a number of shareholder resolutions at Oil Sands companies.

It is generally believed that processors and transporters are the worst offenders. It is not surprising, therefore, that the first Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) reported came from food processors. But those early studies focused on reducing packaging and energy inputs simply because organic wastes were not considered as serious a threat as in other industrial sectors (e.g., chemical, pulp and paper or mining). However, since the mid-1980s, investigations of environmental impacts of food products became gradually more widespread, and the first published LCAs on food production and processing showed the food chain to be a very large contributor to most LCA impacts parameters. Surprisingly, most impacts are generally located at the farm level, but processing is a major contributor in some sectors. The purpose of this chapter is not to get into highly technical considerations related to LCA, because it is not directed primarily to the LCA practitioner. It is intended rather to arouse the interest of professionals in food processing, such as engineers and technologists, and people working in the food industry who would like to opt for an environmental holistic approach to support decision-making, and for accounting and monitoring purpose using a life cycle perspective. The chapter first discusses some methodological considerations specific to the food processing industry, then lists some limitations and perspective of LCA. The last section will describe briefly the main food transformation processes used, focusing on required natural resources needed (land, water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides) and on generated outputs (food, by-products and wastes). LCA will help quantify the different impacts and will show the relative influence of each food step in order to provide a clearer global picture of the situation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon Footprint; Life Cycle Assessment; Life Cycle Assessment Result; Life Cycle Assessment Study; Life Cycle Inventory,,,"Andersson, Karin, Life cycle assessment of bread produced on different scales, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 4, 1, pp. 25-40, (1999); November, (2008); Altieri, Miguel Angel, The ecological role of biodiversity in agroecosystems, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 74, 1-3, pp. 19-31, (1999); Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Lca in the Agri Food Sector Zurich November, (2008); Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Lca in the Agri Food Sector Zurich November, (2008); Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Lca in the Agri Food Sector Zurich November, (2008); Relating Land Use to Consumed Goods Using Input Output Life Cycle Assessment Method, (2009); Fruit and Vegetable Processing, (1995); Davis, Jennifer, Life cycle assessment of integrated food chains - A Swedish case study of two chicken meals, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 13, 7, pp. 574-584, (2008); In European Conference on Waste Reduction Brussels Belgium, (2009)",,Springer,,15710297,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032678351,

As a consequence of over two centuries of industrialization, the global carbon budget and its associated global balance sheet of carbon have clearly diverged from a state of natural equilibrium. Three material identifiable, types of carbon risk have emerged; related to regulation, to physical processes and to market-related risk. 'Cap-and-trade' schemes are an important economic mechanism aiding both the rectification of these imbalances and the restoration of a natural carbon cycle disrupted by emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) in both developed and emerging economies. Such schemes establish an economic value to carbon through open market trading. They serve to quantify and to reduce carbon risk, in accordance with appropriate and efficient economic regulation. Monetizing carbon liability through these market mechanisms is a means to place boundaries on, and thus to mitigate, the uncertainties of carbon liability. This process of monetization may also transform market risk into an opportunity for economic exploitation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Budget Control; Commerce; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Economic Mechanisms; Economic Regulations; Emerging Economies; Global Economic Activity; Greenhouse Gas (ghg); Market Mechanisms; Natural Equilibrium; Physical Process; Carbon,Budget control; Commerce; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Economic mechanisms; Economic regulations; Emerging economies; Global economic activity; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Market mechanisms; Natural equilibrium; Physical process; Carbon,,"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2025); Valuing Potential Environmental Liabilities for Managerial Decision Making A Review of Available Techniques Unep Fi PRI Universal Ownership October 2010, (1996); Stern, Nicholas H., The economics of climate change: The stern review, 9780521877251, pp. 1-692, (2007); Explanation on Emission Trading Schemes, (2010); Legal Aspects of Carbon Trading, (2009); Financial Reporting of Environmental Liabilities and Risks After Sarbanes Oxley, (2006)",,Springer US,,,9781441979902; 9781441979919,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027378971,

This is particularly true for institutional investors who manage our retirement savings. Simultaneously there is increased demand that financial assets be invested with an understanding of long-term environmental and social sustainability. Responsible investing provides a long-term sustainable investment strategy that values environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment decision-making. Responsible Investing has always had a broad mandate. Put simply, it is a long-term sustainable investment strategy that seeks to reduce risk in investment portfolios through managing ESG issues in today’s corporations.

In October 2007, Al Gore and the IPCC received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on climate change. From then, multi-billion estimates of climate finance needs started to emerge - for example, see Project Catalyst (2009) for an annual estimate of US{dollar}65-100 billion. In December 2009, more than 100 heads of state met at the Copenhagen climate summit in the biggest such gathering ever held outside the UN headquarters in New York. But since then, there has been a marked decline in the relevance of climate policy due to several factors. The most important was surely the failure of the Copenhagen conference to agree on an international post-2012 climate policy regime. Moreover, the financial crisis of 2008 has weakened the public budgets of industrialized countries to such an extent that severe fiscal crises have followed. The EU, which used to be a leader in climate policy, is struggling to preserve its currency union. Policy-makers are thus preoccupied with restoring the fiscal health of their countries in the short term and have a tendency to ignore longer-term issues such as climate change. They are also more inclined to choose a narrow domestic policy perspective. Even if the health of public budgets was better than it is today, in a situation of increased industrial competition between advanced developing and industrialized countries, industry lobbies would object to climate finance streams that subsidize their competitors (see Ghosh 2010). So after the end of FSF, the mobilization of large volumes of public funds for climate finance seems out of the question (see also Chapter 9), unless innovative sources of public funds can be found that are directly linked to climate change. An air-traffic tax or the revenues from auctioning of emissions allowances could be such sources. In fact, the German climate finance programme has been built on auction revenues of EU allowances. Van Melle et al. (2011) stress that the most difficult stage in financing mitigation measures is the upscaling of mitigation activities and that climate finance should focus on leveraging of private investments. However, Stadelmann et al. (2011) find that the leverage factor is not a convincing indicator for mitigation. For CDM projects, a high leverage factor might even be an indication that the project is not additional, and thus does not mobilize climate finance at all. In a few years, the results of the FSF projects can be evaluated. Given the hasty procedures of finance allocation (see Chapter 5), and the lack of performance criteria in project selection (see Chapter 4), it is likely that performance will be mixed at best. A severely insufficient performance of climate finance would lead to a political backlash against future public climate finance. This has to be prevented by all means. The disillusionment with development finance in the 1980s and the ensuing impact on finance volumes and procedures give us a historical analogy. The fiscal balance of advanced developing countries is much better than in most industrialized countries. As shown in Chapter 3, some of those countries have financed domestic programmes with massive climate benefits. If governments of these advanced developing countries want to promote export of the industries set-up in response to these programmes, they could become important sources of climate finance. However, this type of finance would certainly be tied to use of the technologies, which could lead to inefficiencies. In the next decade we could thus find ourselves in a situation where public support for climate finance decreases even if climate finance needs to increase substantially. We discuss how the development assistance community dealt with a similar situation three decades ago. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Financing the Response to Climate Change, (2010); Global Corruption Report 2009 Corruption and the Private Sector, (2009); Clearing the Air Moving on from Carbon Trading to Real Climate Solutions, (2010); Ops4 Progress Toward Impact Fourth Overall Performance Study of the Gef, (2010); Harnessing the Power Shift Clean Technologies Innovative Finance and the Challenge for Climate Governance, (2010); Catalyzing Climate Finance A Guidebook on Policy and Financing Options to Support Green Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development, (2011); Mathews, John A., Climate bonds: Mobilizing private financing for carbon management, Carbon Management, 1, 1, pp. 9-13, (2010); Structuring International Financial Support for Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries, (2010); Billions at Stake in Climate Finance Four Key Lessons, (2009); Scaling Up Climate Finance, (2009)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9781849714747; 9781136471261,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026352104,

While the emerging demand for biofuels represents an opportunity for developing countries, it also poses a host of social and environmental risks. Large investments are needed to finance expansion of biofuel and feedstock production, suggesting that the financial sector may have a crucial role to play in mitigating these risks. This paper seeks to explore the role of financiers in expanding biofuel feedstock production and refining in tropical forest-rich countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America to better understand the role and future potential of responsible finance in the biofuel sector. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis draws on published data and reports from academia, industry, governments, civil society and the press, to quantify the magnitude and source of investments made from 2000-2010 in 16 countries sampled from ""ecoregions"" subject to high rates of forest conversion, weak land tenure institutions, and vulnerable communities. Findings: It is found that the case study countries received USD 5.3-7.3 billion for feedstock production and USD 5.7-6.7 billion for biofuel refining between 2000 and 2009. This was financed by a mix of entrepreneurs, private banks, investors, governments and multilateral banks. While no clear patterns emerge, foreign banks and institutional investors rank as ""important"" for most feedstocks and regions. Multilateral banks and domestic institutional investors seem to be the least important. Few financiers have criteria in place in order to ensure sustainable investing practices, and those who do tend to have policies of limited quality. Originality/value: While much has been written on biofuel sustainability and governance, there is little research that delineates the nature of investment and finance in the sector. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biofuels; Energy Sources; Finance; Investments; Responsibility Accounting; Responsible Finance; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Tropical Deforestation,,,"Meals Per Gallon the Impact of Industrial Biofuels on People and Global Hunger, (2010); Ann Assoc Am Geographers, (2011); undefined, (2012); Banktrack Welcomes Unep Fi Plans to Weed Out Free Riders, (2005); Outside Job Turning the Equator Principles Towards People and Planet, (2010); About Banktrack, (2011); Manchester Journal of International Economic Law, (2009); About Bonsucro, (2011); Borras, Saturnino M., Towards a better understanding of global land grabbing: An editorial introduction, Journal of Peasant Studies, 38, 2, pp. 209-216, (2011); undefined, (2010)",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,2040803X; 20408021,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872650565,

Hoepner and John O.S. Wilson* 24.1 INTRODUCTION Banks play critical roles in every economy. They operate the payments system, are a source of credit for large parts of the economy, and (except in times of crisis) act as a safe haven for depositors’ funds. The banking system aids in allocating resources from those in surplus (depositors) to those in deficit (borrowers) by transforming relatively small liquid deposits into larger illiquid loans. Via this intermediation process, banks help match deposit and loan supply and provide liquidity to an economy. If intermediation is undertaken in an efficient manner, then deposit and credit demands can be met at low cost, benefiting the parties concerned as well as the economy overall (via positive externalities including long-term economic growth and progress in human development). The recent financial crisis, however, has brought a focus on negative externalities in banking such as the contagious effects of bank failures and costs of government bailouts. Tangential to these, but by no means less important, are social, environmental, ethical and trust issues (SEET). Over the last decade, corporate social responsibility has developed into an important strategy to enable firms to increase and smooth cash flows through consumer goodwill and loyalty, respectively (Carroll, 1999; Carroll and Shabana, 2010; Mintzberg, 1983). Consequently, a number of researchers have investigated the impact of corporate social responsibility or corporate environmental management on organizational performance (Becchetti et al., 2009; Griffin and Mahon, 1997; Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

It covers the six most important renewable energy sources - bioenergy, solar, geothermal, hydropower, ocean and wind energy - as well as their integration into present and future energy systems. It considers the environmental and social consequences associated with the deployment of these technologies, and presents strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application and diffusion. SRREN brings a broad spectrum of technology-specific experts together with scientists studying energy systems as a whole. Prepared following strict IPCC procedures, it presents an impartial assessment of the current state of knowledge: it is policy relevant but not policy prescriptive. SRREN is an invaluable assessment of the potential role of renewable energy for the mitigation of climate change for policymakers, the private sector, and academic researchers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Technology; Geothermal Energy; Natural Resources; Renewable Energy Resources; Wind Power; Broad Spectrum; Climate Change Mitigation; Future Energies; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Changes; Private Sectors; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Source; Social Consequences; Climate Change,Environmental technology; Geothermal energy; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Broad spectrum; Climate change mitigation; Future energies; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Private sectors; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Social consequences; Climate change,,"Åhman, Max, Path dependency and the future of advanced vehicles and biofuels, Utilities Policy, 16, 2, pp. 80-89, (2008); Ambrose, Michael D., Energy-efficient planning and design, 9780203928325, pp. 238-249, (2009); Archer, Cristina L., Evaluation of global wind power, Journal of Geophysical Research, 110, 12, pp. 1-20, (2005); Rapidly Growing Solar Installer also Provides Clean Cooking, (2008); Asif, Muhammad, Energy supply, its demand and security issues for developed and emerging economies, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 11, 7, pp. 1388-1413, (2007); Clean Energy Technologies A Preliminary Inventory of the Potential for Electricity Generation, (2005); Climate Change 2007 Mitigation Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2007); Intellectual Property and Access to Clean Energy Technologies in Developing Countries an Analysis of Solar Photovoltaic Biofuel and Wind Technologies, (2007); Barua, Dipal C., A photovoltaic solar home system dissemination model, Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, 9, 4, pp. 313-322, (2001); Bator, Francis M., The anatomy of market failure, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 72, 3, pp. 351-379, (1958)",,Cambridge University Press,,,9781107023406; 9781139151153,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933519732,

While much blame has been targeted at compensation arrangements that rewarded extreme risk-taking but did not punish failure, the performance of large, supposedly sophisticated institutional investors in this crisis has gone for the most part unexamined. Shareholding organizations, such as pension funds and mutual funds, hold considerable sway over the financial industry from Wall Street to the City of London. Corporate Governance Failures: The Role of Institutional Investors in the Global Financial Crisis exposes the misdeeds and lapses of these institutional investors leading up to the recent economic meltdown. In this collection of original essays, edited by pioneers in the field of fiduciary capitalism, top legal and financial practitioners and researchers discuss detrimental actions and inaction of institutional investors. Corporate Governance Failures reveals how these organizations exposed themselves and their clientele to extremely complex financial instruments, such as credit default swaps, through investments in hedge and private equity funds as well as more traditional equity investments in large financial institutions. The book's contributors critique fund executives for tolerating the ""pursuit of alpha"" culture that led managers to pursue risky financial strategies in hopes of outperforming the market. The volume also points out how and why institutional investors failed to effectively monitor such volatile investments, ignoring relatively well-established corporate governance principles and best practices. Along with detailed investigations of institutional investor missteps, Corporate Governance Failures offers nuanced and realistic proposals to mitigate future financial pitfalls. This volume provides fresh perspectives on ways institutional investors can best act as gatekeepers and promote responsible investment. Copyright © 2011 University of Pennsylvania Press.

The book Framework and Tools for Environmental Management in Africa is written from this perspective. It provides researchers from different disciplines including environmental sciences, engineering, commerce, planning, education, agriculture and law, as well as NGOs, government officials, policy makers and researchers, with a platform to engage with concerns relating to sustainable environmental management in this epoch. Topics covered include global landmarks for environmental governance, environmental management on African agenda, sustainability reporting, environmental impact assessment and public participation as well as environmental education. These remain viable in the African set-up where major development projects in mining and agriculture require greater scrutiny. With a collection of both revision and critical reflection questions, carefully constructed by authors with significant experiences from institutions of higher learning across Africa, readers will find this publication a valuable addition to their shelves. © CODESRIA 2011.

It lends an evolutionary perspective to how social-ecological interactions change. Thus, we argue that an improved understanding of how social-ecological systems have evolved up to the present is necessary for the modelling, understanding and anticipation of current and future social-ecological systems. Here we consider the implications of an evolutionary perspective for designing research approaches. One desirable approach is the creation of multi-decadal records produced by integrating palaeoen-vironmental, instrument and documentary sources at multiple spatial scales. We also consider the potential for improved analytical and modelling approaches by developing system dynamical, cellular and agent-based models, observing complex behaviour in social-ecological systems against which to test systems dynamical theory, and drawing better lessons from history. Alongside these is the need to find more appropriate ways to communicate complex systems, risk and uncertainty to the public and to policy-makers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Modeling; Ecosystem Service; Evolutionary Perspectives; Management Strategy; Multi-decadal; Paleoenvironmental Records; Social-ecological System; Autonomous Agents; Computational Methods; Dynamic Models; Ecosystems; Storms; Ecosystem Services; Evolutionary Perspective; Management Strategies; Multi-decadal; Paleoenvironmental Records; Social-ecological Systems; Dynamical Systems; Ecological Modeling; Evolutionary Theory; Future Prospect; Management Practice; Paleoenvironment; Policy Making; Research Method; Storm; Article; Climate Change; Community Ecology; Environmental Management; Evolution; Article; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Human Relation; Information Processing; Methodology; Theoretical Model; Biological Evolution; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Ecosystem; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Theoretical","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Dynamic models; Ecosystems; Storms; Ecosystem services; Evolutionary perspective; Management strategies; Multi-decadal; Paleoenvironmental records; Social-ecological systems; Dynamical systems; ecological modeling; evolutionary theory; future prospect; management practice; paleoenvironment; policy making; research method; storm; Article; climate change; community ecology; environmental management; evolution; article; ecosystem; environmental protection; human relation; information processing; methodology; theoretical model; Biological Evolution; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Ecosystem; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Theoretical",,"Adger, W.

The question is: What is the incentive, from a private sector point of view, to invest in nature, and what are the barriers and opportunities? This article demonstrates that new markets and business models are developing which are based on BES, thereby offering investment opportunities and contributing to nature conservation at the same time. Emerging BES markets include (i) sustainable forestry; (ii) ecotourism; (iii) carbon sequestration through forestry, agricultural projects and REDD (Reducing Emissions through Deforestation and Forest Degradation); (iv) watershed management; and (v) nature conservation and restoration such as wetland banking and biodiversity offset programmes. This article gives an analysis of the various business models and the factors that support a proper functioning thereof, including the dependence on public regulation and the necessity to collaborate with local communities, authorities, NGOs or other stakeholders. In the analysis, barriers for attracting mainstream capital from institutional investors into BES business are identified and addressed. © 2011 Taylor and Francis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Eco-tourism; Investing In Biodiversity; Paying For Ecosystem Services; Pro-biodiversity Business; Sustainable Forestry; Watershed Management; Biodiversity; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem Service; Ecotourism; Entrepreneur; Environmental Economics; Nature Conservation; Nongovernmental Organization; Private Sector; Stakeholder; Sustainable Forestry,biodiversity; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; ecotourism; entrepreneur; environmental economics; nature conservation; nongovernmental organization; private sector; stakeholder; sustainable forestry,"The Vittel PES business case is as follows. Vittel had calculated that the protection of an existing water source is more cost-effective than building a new filtration plant or transferring its operations to new sources (Perrot-Maitre and Davis 2001). Vittel therefore decided to finance ‘quality drinking water’ through compensation for services of landholders located around the springs. The farmers agreed to adopt less intensive farming practices in order to reduce agricultural run-off of herbicides and other pollutants. Vittel financed the programme with the support of the French National Agricultural Institute (INRA) and the French Water Agencies. The level of non-point-source pollution10 was reduced significantly and, according to a cost-benefit analysis study of the Vittel case by INRA, the project was economically justifiable (Perrot-Maitre 2007). The Vittel model might however be difficult to implement in a large geographical area, or in a region with many farmers without government support.","Business Model Internet, (2009); Carbon Offsetting Trends Survey Oxford Uk Ecosecurities and Climatebiz, (2008); Are You A Green Leader Business and Biodiversity Making the Case for A Lasting Solution, (2010); Making Environmental Markets Work Lessons from Early Experience with Sulphur Carbon Wetlands and Other Related Markets, (2004); BenDor, Todd K., A dynamic analysis of the wetland mitigation process and its effects on no net loss policy, Landscape and Urban Planning, 89, 1-2, pp. 17-27, (2009); Payments for Ecosystem Services in Costa Rica and Forest Law no 7575 Key Lessons for Legislators Internet, (2008); undefined, (2010); Building Biodiversity Business, (2008); Boreal Forest, (2011); Final Report Ecologic A Project Under Framework Contract for Economic Analysis Env G 1 Fra 2004 0081, (2006)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at,,21513740; 21513732,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860449778,

The commodification of pollution is inspired by the rationale of market efficiency: major polluters issued with permits are incentivized to emit less, thereby enabling them to make a profit selling excess permits to those less efficient.

Illegal logging of forested lands, generally termed as common property resources, or as customary or community ownership, which may lack ownership altogether, has rendered barren millions of hectares within the Mau Complex in Kenya and across the continent. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deforestation; Degradation; Environmental Planning; Logging (timber); United Nations Environment Program; Durban; Kwazulu-natal; South Africa,deforestation; degradation; environmental planning; logging (timber); United Nations Environment Program; Durban; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa,"Policies resulting in the displacement of vulnerable peoples like the Ogiek mark the general trend of REDD projects. Of 144 projects assessed by the International Institute for Environment and Development, just one project ‘‘included a proposal to make community-managed forests or indigenous peoples’ rights a binding part of REDD’’ (Vidal 2009). And despite peoples such as the Ogiek possessing the complex knowledge base required to monitor and protect the Mau Complex, this cannot be done without according legal rights to indigenous peoples, who occupy such land through customary and community ownership. These are the people branded by the Kenyan government as squatters. According to the Washington-based Rights and Resources Institute, the process would cost just US$3.50 per hectare (Ostrom 2009). But the ‘‘paper parks’’ backed by the UN have failed to acknowledge forests as ‘‘socio-ecological ecosystems,’’ preferring instead to protect ‘‘natural’’ land devoid* or cleansed*of peoples, leading to the rationales of the conservation and privatization tradition.","Ethiopian Herald, (2007); Bond, Patrick, Privatization of the air turns lethal: ""Pay to pollute"" principle kills South African activist Sajida Khan, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 18, 4, pp. 6-37, (2007); Mercury, (2011); Update on the Climate Investment Funds, (2010); Guidelines for Inventorying and Monitoring Carbon Offsets in Forest Based Projects, (1999); Interview with Green Resources Mutuma Marangu, (2010); Reforestation Vital for Africa Climate Developer, (2010); Signposts to Copenhagen August 4, (2009); A Realistic Policy on International Carbon Offsets, (2008); Mother Jones, (2008)",,,,15483290; 10455752,,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857270497,

The production of sugar from sugarcane contributes to these carbon emissions. For example, bagasse, a by-product of sugar production is burnt, and the heat is used to turn water into steam. Some of the steam is used in the sugar process - the rest is used to generate electricity. The burnt bagasse releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change. Likewise, transportation of sugarcane from the plantation to the mill by road or rail generates carbon dioxide emissions. In this study a life cycle assessment (LCA) method is to assess the environmental burden of sugar production from sugarcane. The production of sugar leads to an increase in emissions which is due to the bagasse burnt, and also from cane transportation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bagasse; Carbon Emissions; Climate Change; Life Cycle Assessment; Sugar Cane; Carbon Dioxide Emissions; Carbon Emissions; Environmental Burdens; Generate Electricity; Life Cycle Assessment; Life-cycle Assessments; South Africa; Bagasse; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Global Warming; Life Cycle; Sugar Cane; Sugars,Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Environmental burdens; Generate electricity; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle assessments; South Africa; Bagasse; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Global warming; Life cycle; Sugar cane; Sugars,,"Bjor̈klund, Anna Elisabeth, Survey of approaches to improve reliability in LCA, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 7, 2, pp. 64-72, (2002); Energy Consumption for Farming Biomass, (2008); Government Gazette, (2004); Energy Conservation Opportunities in Sugar Industry, (2007); Energy Management, (2007); Environmental Life Cycle Implications of Using Bagasse Derived Ethanol as A Gasoline Oxygenate in Mumbai Bombay, (2000); Characterization of the Coal Reserves of South Africa, (2004); Innovative Technologies from Brazil and the Challenge for South South Co Operation, (2012); First Steps in Research, (2007); International Conference on Energy Security and Climate Change Issues Strategies and Options Escc 2009, (2009)",,,Int.

(RME) is based in Boston, MA and is developing ocean wave energy converters (WECs) to benefit remote off-grid communities in developing nations. Our two WEC technologies are based on the heaving and surging motion of a buoy on the ocean surface (the 3-D WEC) and on a bottom-mounted hinged paddle that oscillates in the full water column (the Surge WEC). Our computer models and wave tank tests have revealed conversion efficiencies as high as 31% in random sea states for the 3-D WEC and 40% for the Surge WEC. Our objective is to complete all the testing and prototyping of both WECs by the end of 2012. RME plans to use the Surge WEC in conjunction with a reverse osmosis seawater desalination system in order to provide fresh water to coastal communities in developing countries. The proposed system will operate completely off-grid and will represent a clean and low-cost solution to the water scarcity problem commonly faced by remote communities. The fresh water production process comprises three stages: energy extraction from waves, process water acquisition and pressure regulation, and reverse osmosis. We estimate that an array of about 25 Surge WECs can produce 0.9 million m3 of fresh water per year, which is enough to meet the water needs of about 30,000 people while eliminating about 104 thousand tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. RME has identified a municipality in South Africa as its launch customer and has the support of the South African Department of Water Affairs to develop the project. In South Africa, 1.97 million people live on the coast where wave energy is abundant and each person needs an additional 700 m3 of water per person per year to comply with United Nations Millennium Development Goals. After the first deployment, RME will expand to other remote communities in South Africa. © 2011 IEEE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coastal Communities; Desalination; Ocean Wave Energy; Renewable Energy; Water; Carbon Dioxide Emissions; Coastal Communities; Computer Models; Desalination Systems; Energy Extraction; Energy-driven; Fresh Water; Fresh Water Production; Low-cost Solution; Marine Energy; Millennium Development Goals; Ocean Surfaces; Ocean-wave Energy; Off-grids; Process Water; Random Sea State; Remote Communities; Renewable Energies; Seawater Desalination Systems; South Africa; Three Stages; United Nations; Water Columns; Water Needs; Water Scarcity; Wave Energy; Wave Tank Tests; Carbon Dioxide; Conversion Efficiency; Desalination; Developing Countries; Energy Policy; Global Warming; Ocean Currents; Reverse Osmosis; Sailing Vessels; Seawater; Surface Waters; Three Dimensional; Water; Water Filtration; Water Waves; Wave Power; Wave Energy Conversion,Carbon dioxide emissions; Coastal communities; Computer models; Desalination systems; Energy extraction; Energy-driven; Fresh Water; Fresh water production; Low-cost solution; Marine energy; Millennium development goals; Ocean surfaces; Ocean-wave energy; Off-grids; Process water; Random sea state; Remote communities; Renewable energies; Seawater desalination systems; South Africa; Three stages; United Nations; Water columns; Water needs; Water scarcity; Wave energy; Wave tank tests; Carbon dioxide; Conversion efficiency; Desalination; Developing countries; Energy policy; Global warming; Ocean currents; Reverse osmosis; Sailing vessels; Seawater; Surface waters; Three dimensional; Water; Water filtration; Water waves; Wave power; Wave energy conversion,,"Water Resources Sector Strategy Strategic Directions for World Bank Engagement, (2004); Folley, Matt S., The Oscillating Wave Surge Converter, Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, pp. 189-193, (2004); Ocean Wave Energy, (2008); Linear Surge Wec, (2012); Small, Christopher, A global analysis of human settlement in coastal zones, Journal of Coastal Research, 19, 3, pp. 584-599, (2003); Chief Liquidity Series, (2009); undefined, (2012); Sagar, Ambuj D., Alleviating energy poverty for the world's poor, Energy Policy, 33, 11, pp. 1367-1372, (2005)",,,IEEE Advancing Technology for Humanity; IEEE Seattle Section; IEEE Region 6; IEEE Foundation; NASA,,9.78077E+12,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855848794,

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from 20 UK investment institutions to derive data which was then coded and analysed, in order to derive a picture of the emerging discourse of private climate change reporting, using an interpretive methodological approach, in addition to explorative analysis using NVivo software. Findings: The authors find that private climate change reporting is dominated by a discourse of risk and risk management. This emerging risk discourse derives from institutional investors' belief that climate change represents a material risk, that it is the most salient sustainability issue, and that their clients require them to manage climate change-related risk within their portfolio investment. It is found that institutional investors are using the private reporting process to compensate for the acknowledged inadequacies of public climate change reporting. Contrary to evidence indicating corporate capture of public sustainability reporting, these findings suggest that the emerging private climate change reporting discourse is being captured by the institutional investment community. There is also evidence of an emerging discourse of opportunity in private climate change reporting as the institutional investors are increasingly aware of a range of ways in which climate change presents material opportunities for their investee companies to exploit. Lastly, the authors find an absence of any ethical discourse, such that private climate change reporting reinforces rather than challenges the ""business case"" status quo. Originality/value: Although there is a wealth of sustainability reporting research, there is no academic research on private climate change reporting. This paper attempts to fill this gap by providing rich interview evidence regarding the nature of the emerging private climate change reporting discourse. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Private Climate Change Reporting; Risk Discourse; Risk Management; Risk Society; Sustainability Reporting,,,"Improving Climate Change Reporting an Acca and Ftse Group Discussion Paper, (2007); Alvesson, Mats, Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis, Human Relations, 53, 9, pp. 1125-1149, (2000); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Why companies go green: A model of ecological responsiveness, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 4, pp. 717-736, (2000); Qualitative Data Analysis with Nvivo, (2007); Bebbington, Jan, An account of sustainability: Failure, success and a reconceptualization, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 12, 5, pp. 557-587, (2001); Bebbington, Jan, Theorizing engagement: The potential of a critical dialogic approach, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 20, 3, pp. 356-381, (2007); Risk Society Towards A New Modernity, (1992); Beck, Ulrich, Subpolitics: Ecology and the disintegration of institutional power, Organization and Environment, 10, 1, pp. 52-65, (1997); World Risk Society, (1999); Social Construction of Reality, (1966)",,,,09513574,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055059598,

For public and private investors alike, these issues have now become part of mainstream investment practices, reflecting a greater understanding that they represent material risks and opportunities that must be addressed as part of fiduciary duty. Some ESG issues require an approach that goes far beyond the traditional simple screening approaches that the early niche funds employed. This is illustrated through a detailed discussion of investor practices on climate change, which must include an assessment of long-term risks and opportunities and of the strategies that have been put in place to address these. It is also argued that as the role of policy and regulation is critical to shifting the economics in favour of low carbon investments, a structured dialogue between investors and policy-makers is critical to ensuring that institutional capital is mobilized to support the policy goals of limiting climate change whilst still allowing investors to operate in line with their fiduciary responsibility. © 2011 The author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on the authors' previous contributions to the discussion on sustainability and valuation, presents advances on these previous works and condenses the more theoretical issues debated earlier into concrete recommendations for future action. Starting from a literature review of the different strands of research relating to the new discipline of sustainable property investment, 31 publications and ten research projects that investigate in detail the topic of sustainability and property valuation are identified and the current stage of discussion is briefly commented on. On this basis, a systematisation of existing approaches for the integration of sustainability issues into the valuation process is presented, followed by further explanations of practical valuation issues such as identifying the key ""adjustment screws"" or valuation input parameters of traditional valuation methods. Finally, the underlying concept of property value is discussed and a ""value map"" is presented which conceptualises the relationships between different components of value as well as other value-influencing forces. Findings: Changes are required in the processes of gathering, processing and presenting property-related information, as well as in the methods for determining individual valuation-input parameters and for explicitly stating formerly implicit assumptions and qualitative judgement. This includes but is not limited to the extension of the scope and informational content of standard valuation reports to include sensitivity analyses, risk documentation and a separate section on sustainability. The required changes should be supported by actions that could be undertaken by the professional and valuation-standard-setting bodies and organisations within the valuation world. These actions include: embracing and improved marketing of the qualitative nature of the valuation service; the development of educational material and formal guidelines; the provision of dedicated market research to assist valuation practitioners operating in different market segments, geographic regions and local sub-markets; and adjusting and further developing existing valuation standards to enable and support individual practitioners in offering a two-tier valuation service to clients. Originality/value: This paper proposes that valuation professionals and their professional bodies are confronted with a new reality of changing value perceptions and systems among market participants, and offers practical recommendations on how to cope with this situation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Asset Valuation; Property; Property Valuation; Sustainability; Valuation Methods; Value,,,"Valuing Green how Green Buildings Affect Property Values and Getting the Valuation Method Right, (2008); Bügl, Robert, Sustainable property funds: Financial stakeholders' views on sustainability criteria and market acceptance, Building Research and Information, 37, 3, pp. 246-263, (2009); Canonne, Jean, Valuation without value theory: A North American ""appraisal, Journal of Real Estate Practice and Education, 6, 1, pp. 113-162, (2003); Green Building Investment Underwriting Standards, (2008); Cole, Raymond J., Shared markets: Coexisting building environmental assessment methods, Building Research and Information, 34, 4, pp. 357-371, (2006); Sustainability Perceptions and Trends A Corenet Global Research Bulletin, (2008); Ellison, Louise, Assessing sustainability in the existing commercial property stock: Establishing sustainability criteria relevant for the commercial property investment sector, Property Management, 25, 3, pp. 287-304, (2007); French, Nick S., The uncertainty of valuation, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 22, 6, pp. 484-500, (2004); French, Nick S., Discounted cash flow: Accounting for uncertainty, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 23, 1, pp. 75-89, (2005); Green Noise or Green Value Measuring the Price Effects of Environmental Certification in Commercial Buildings, (2008)",,,,1463578X,,,,English,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053314070,

An ambitious report from the United Nations Environment Programme's Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), commonly referred to as the 'Freshfields report', has recently given rise to considerable optimism on this issue among proponents of SRI. The present article puts the arguments of the Freshfields report into some further both empirical and critical perspective, however, and suggests that its findings do not call for very much optimism. The general argument is that while the understanding of fiduciary duty outlined by the Freshfields report seems to allow institutional investors to at least sometimes take some social or environmental considerations into account, the support it gives for SRI is notably contingent and, furthermore, it rules out exactly the kind of SRI which proponents of social responsibility and environmental sustainability should hold in highest regard - proactive cases and socially effective investment strategies. If SRI is to become an important force for corporate social responsibility through its adoption by institutional investors, then, it is suggested that legal reform is needed. © 2010 Springer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ethical Investment; Fiduciary Duty; Fresh-fields Report; Institutional Investors; Legal Reform; Prudent Investor Rule; Social Effectiveness; Socially Responsible Investment; United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative,,"This article was much improved by helpful comments from the editor, three reviewers and two informal advisors with Journal of Business Ethics.

Yet, German financial institutions are amongst the European laggards in adopting environmentally and socially informed approaches to investment. This article identifies a variety of legal, institutional and attitudinal factors which hinder the growth of the German SRI market. Its paltry size does not reflect evidence of any specific disinterest among German investors in social and environmental issues. Rather, it arises from a combination of structural impediments, particularly the institutional arrangements for German pension schemes that hinder their participation in financial markets, regulations which encourage conservative investments, and investors' preference for low-risk assets and avoidance of shareholder activism.

It thus examines a relatively neglected aspect of fiduciary finance, which so far has focused on whether SRI is ‘financially material’ to investment performance. It argues that by reframing fiduciary finance as an active relationship rather than merely the mechanical application of legal duties, we may allow trustees to invest socially pursuant to the wishes of beneficiaries. However, this article also suggests that considerable legal and practical obstacles confront this path to SRI. They include the trustees' duty to treat different beneficiaries even-handedly and the traditionally passive role that trust law has cast beneficiaries. Reliance on widely held social customs and evaluation of third parties' interests as a proxy for the will of beneficiaries, and the role of statutory reforms mandating consultation with and representation of beneficiaries on the governing boards of trustees, are also considered in this article. It concludes by suggesting some potential legal reforms to strengthen reliance on the will of beneficiaries as a means of SRI. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Beneficiaries; Fiduciary Duties; Institutional Investors; Legal Reform; Socially Responsible Investment; Trustees,,,"Iowa Law Review, (2018); Law and Contemporary Problems, (1993); Restatement of the Law Trusts, (2003); Anand, Paul, The ethical investor: Exploring dimensions of investment behaviour, Journal of Economic Psychology, 14, 2, pp. 377-385, (1993); Amess, Kevin, Corporate governance structures and the comparative advantage of credit unions, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 9, 1, pp. 59-65, (2001); Pepperdine Law Review, (1992); Strong Democracy Participatory Politics for A New Age, (1984); Journal of Investing, (2005); Trust Law International, (2002); UCLA Law Review, (1992)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at,,20430795; 20430809,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876434730,

As the cliché goes, hindsight is a wonderful thing, and given this analysis it would seem axiomatic that commentators would identify the poor governance of international and domestic financial institutions as a leverage point for reform. And indeed they did - in 1999. In commenting on the lessons to be learned from the Asian financial crisis Jeffrey Garten, Dean of the Yale School of Management at the time, delineated a scenario virtually identical to the GFC, in which lenders and investors in an inherently unstable and overstretched financial system failed to read the signs, deluded themselves about the nature of the markets they were involved in, and fled at the first indication that the good times were over (Garten 1999). This led him to conclude that better governance of financial institutions and corporations was a solution that would help mitigate the next crisis. Yet 10 years later, analysts are still calling for global governance reform, and have extended their criticisms to include intergovernmental processes, which they consider to have lost their legitimacy (Bradford and Linn 2009). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Governance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Global Compact; Global Financial Crisis; Global Reporting Initiative,,,"Human Right to Development in A Globalized World, (2008); New Modes of Governance in the Global System Exploring Publicness Delegation and Inclusiveness, (2006); Corporate Social Responsibility Companies in the News Enron Mallenbaker Website, (2007); 160173, (2007); Bebchuk, Lucian A., The elusive quest for global governance standards, University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 157, 5, pp. 1263-1317, (2009); Bernstein, Steven, Non-state global governance: Is forest certification a legitimate alternative to a global forest convention?, pp. 33-63, (2017); United Nations Divided World the Un S Roles in International Relations, (1993); Managing Performance International Comparisons, (2008); G 20 Summit could the Financial Crisis Push Global Governance Reform Borokings Institute Website, (2008); University of Tasmania, (2009)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,09256733; 22151680,,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113415353,

It explores problems surrounding the implementation of such schemes, including the role of vested interests, the impact of subtle design details, and opportunities to attract long-term investments.

Responding to threats such as pollution, loss of biodiversity or climatic changes requires public policy intervention, as well as private action and significant new capital investments. Under the caption of “sustainable development’ more and more private companies and national governments pledge to balance the economic, social and environmental effects of growth. Innovative solutions are being developed and tested, especially in the context of financing the required action. One particular area that receives increasing attention is how best to foster public and private investments in environmental protection. This is especially relevant for low-income countries: often those most exposed to environmental changes are least capable to respond to the threats, and require financial and technical support from developed countries and donors. Most commentators have focused on the role of public policy in facilitating the required environmental investments. Conversely, the application of financial instruments such as insurance is still under-researched. Insurance risk transfer has been used for centuries as a tool to manage the risk of uncertain losses. In its most basic form insurance is a mechanism where risks or part of a risk are transferred from one party (the insured) to another party (the insurer) in return for a payment (the premium). The insurer pays out a previously agreed amount if the insured experiences a loss, or if a predefined event occurs. In other words, the insured pays a certain premium to reduce the risk of an uncertain loss. This reduction in uncertainty is widely seen as an important mechanism driving our economic systems: without insurance many activities and processes would be deemed too risky and would not be undertaken. Moreover, in the event of a loss, those affected might struggle to recover. In economic terms the justification for any insurance is derived from the welfare function, which means that the provision of insurance can increase the expected utility of individuals, companies or society. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"What is the Role of Insurance in Economic Development, (2008); Leveraging Private Investment the Role of Public Sector Climate Finance, (2011); Coping with Climate Change Risks and Opportunities for Insurers, (2009); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2011); Freeman, Paul K., Environmental insurance as a policy enforcement tool in developing countries, University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Economic Law, 18, 2, (1997); Managing Environmental Risk Through Insurance, (1997); Risk Management and Insurance Review, (2005); Ibarra, Hector, Innovation in risk transfer for natural hazards impacting agriculture, Environmental Hazards, 7, 1, pp. 62-69, (2007); Journal of Integrated Disaster Risk Management, (2011); Insurance Market Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, (2007)",,Cambridge University Press,,,9781107030770; 9781139344289,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919619333,

Attention is also given to the current status of philanthropy, RI and impact investing internationally and locally. A review of 53 local RI funds established over the period 1 June 1992 to 31 December 2010 reveal that the majority have an impact investing focus, either on its own or in combination with other RI strategies.

Recent experience in oil spill risk assessments will be presented to highlight the criticality of smart stewardship of environmental capital and services by responsible governments dealing with energy development in biodiverse and sensitive coastal zones. All too often the $ value of ecosystem services are only recognized when their functions are lost and have to be replaced e.g. excavation of coral reefs which protect islands for construction material- which has to be later replaced by concrete coastal barriers or removal of mangroves for coastal development with consequential increases in erosion and decline in fish populations and diversity. Initial steps in paying for ecosystem services have been made through paying landowners to manage land to reduce flood risk or maintain downstream water quality and in carbon sequestration(under the clean development mechanism )provide a conceptual template for the future . At a global level, attempts have been made to place a $ value on the worlds natural capital and ecosystem life support services. These values need to be incorporated in today's oil spill contingency planning and protection priorities. A critique of cutting edge formulae for placing ecosystems services on the balance sheet of the public and private sectors, and also the benefits of biodiversity offsets, will be presented .A pioneering approach to how these can be applied in due diligence of investments and oil spill risk assessments over the life cycle of oil and gas developments will be presented. In the future capturing ecosystem services in strategic tradeoffs and decision making in new concessions, oil spill contingency planning, and cumulative effects of long term production water discharges will be on the agenda of governments developing energy resources .Impairment or damage to ecosystem services will have to be paid for in line with the polluter pays principle. This approach will establish a fundamental benchmark in visible corporate social responsibility in addressing stakeholder values future oil spill emergencies.

In Turkey, transportation needs increasing in parallel to urbanization cause an increase in number of vehicles. Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from transportation make up approximately 16% of Turkey's overall greenhouse gas emissions. Turkey signed in the Kyoto protocol on 26 February 2009, and therefore accepted commitments such as developing and implementing policies to prevent climate change and taking measures to increase energy efficiency and energy saving. In this context, such a regulation of banning from traffic those vehicles having old technology and high CO<inf>2</inf> emissions would enable not only recovery of CO<inf>2</inf> but also compliance to ecological principles of recycling of metals such as aluminum and iron and steel found in the end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). Also, the energy sector will make benefit by the recovery and recycling of raw materials. An end-of-life vehicle is composed approximately of 68% iron/steel, 22% aluminum and 8% other metals. In Turkey, number of vehicles of old technology (Pre-Euro) is around 3 millions. In case of banning these vehicles from traffic and recovering all the metals, a significant amount of raw material and energy benefit can be achieved. With such benefits, both of the targets in the recently signed protocol, reduction of emissions and energy recovery can be achieved concurrently and in a short time. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The government has taken many initiatives including promoting utilisation of renewable energy, energy efficiency in industry, building and transport sector, restructuring public transport system, cleaner fuel, stringent emission standards and alternative industrial processes technique. There is also a substantial Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) potential in Malaysia of up to 100 million tonnes CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent for the period 2006 to 2012. At market prices between US$ 3 and 10 per tonne, this corresponds to a total capital inflow to Malaysia from sales of GDM credits (CERs) in the range of RM 1.14 to 3.8 billion. Bilateral and multilateral CDM projects might typically leverage project financing 3 to 4 times this amount, hence contributing substantially to foreign direct investment and technology transfer. Although, the Malaysian government has given much efforts to managing climate change issues, there is still need for improvement includes: integration of programmes in various agencies, adjustment of current sectoral-based approaches, stakeholder's consultation and cooperative actions and expansion of the use of market based instruments as well as carbon taxation and a cap-and-trade programmme augmented by regulatory systems. In addition, there is urgent need to address research and development (R and D) for both adaptation and mitigation. This balancing is required to avoid compromise in economic growth and sustainable development of this country. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Clean Development Mechanism; Climate Change; Mitigation; Adaptation; Clean Development Mechanism; Climate Change; Environmental Management; Foreign Direct Investment; Mitigation; Pollution Tax; Public Transport; Renewable Resource; Technology Transfer; Malaysia,adaptation; clean development mechanism; climate change; environmental management; foreign direct investment; mitigation; pollution tax; public transport; renewable resource; technology transfer; Malaysia,,"Malaysia to Lift Fuel Price Controls, (2008); Proceeding of International Conference on Energy and the Environment Reinvention for Developing Countries, (2009); Proceedings of the Annual Global Business Information Technology and Management for Economic Development Conference, (2009); Begum, Rawshan Ara, Environmental problems in Malaysia: A view of contractors' perception, Journal of Applied Sciences, 8, 22, pp. 4230-4233, (2008); Begum, Rawshan Ara, An empirical assessment of ecological footprint calculations for Malaysia, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 53, 10, pp. 582-587, (2009); Cdm Potential in Malaysia, (2005); A Booklet of the Climate Group, (2007); Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, (2008); Eighth Malaysia Plan 2001 2005, (2001); Ninth Malaysia Plan 2006 2010, (2006)",,,,19947887,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956899705,

This trend is being reflected in a significant increase in the number of corporations that are involved in what is called 'Responsible Investment' (RI) - that is approaches which integrate environmental, social, governance and ethical factors into investment processes. This chapter explores the investor's perspective of the field of corporate social responsibility and more specifically on the practice of Responsible Investment (RI). The aim is threefold: firstly to provide a general background on Responsible Investment - definition, history, actors and trends, secondly, to give an overview of the existing practices of responsible investment and its key characteristics and finally to discuss some critical issues that may shape the future of RI. RI is still a developing and changing activity which is expected to keep growing in the future. But responsible investors can play a major role in transforming the concept of investing by integrating social and environmental dimensions whilst simultaneously pushing up the issue in a company's CSR agenda. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Academy of Management Journal, (1978); Sri What do Investment Managers Think, (2005); Long Term Value Creation Guiding Principles for Corporations and Investors, (2008); Bauer, Rob M.M.J., The ethical mutual fund performance debate: New evidence from Canada, Journal of Business Ethics, 70, 2, pp. 111-124, (2007); International Evidence on Ethical Mutual Fund Performance and Investment Style, (2002); Values for Money Reviewing the Quality of Sri Research, (2004); Importing Socially Responsible Investment in France and Quebec Work of Contextualisation Across Varieties of Capitalism, (2005); Academy of Management Review, (1995); Academy of Management Journal, (1984); Business Ethics A European Review, (1999)",,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,,,9.78364E+12,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053512842,

Canadian environmental law has long been of interest to scholars worldwide, yet its record is often poorly understood. The Article contrasts recent developments with the seemingly progressive initiatives of the 1970s, and analyzes these trends in light of their political, economic, and governance context, as well as the wider critiques of environmental law. It argues that there is considerable room for Canadian governments to adopt more robust methods of environmental law, including following pioneering reforms advanced in other countries. However, even with such steps, further environmental degradation might not be averted unless Canadians are prepared to accept more fundamental changes to their economic systems and social values.

RET can also accelerate the recovery from the current economic crisis thanks to the many environmental, economic and societal benefits that such technologies incorporate. However, traditional accounting methods largely overlook the positive externalities generated by RET and therefore tend to favor conventional energy sources over capital-intensive, alternative energy technologies. Even worse, RET still suffer from a series of biased perceptions and preconceptions that favor status quo energy production models over innovative alternatives. This perspective can help explain why investments in RET, although appealing, still remain below expectations. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we focus on the investment decision making process of a sample of investors with the objective to identify the main determinants of their choices. We propose and test a conceptual model which investigates the role of institutional and behavioural factors in determining the share of renewable energy technologies in the investment portfolios, as well as the degree of technological diversification of these portfolios. Based on the results of our analysis, we derive and discuss implications for scholars, investors, and policy makers. © 2010 IEEE. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accounting Methods; Alternative Energy Technologies; Conceptual Model; Conventional Energy Sources; Economic Crisis; Energy Productions; Global Energy; Investment Decision Making; Investment Decisions; Investment Portfolio; Policy Makers; Renewable Energy Fields; Renewable Energy Technologies; Societal Benefits; Status Quo; Technological Diversification; Decision Making; Economics; Industrial Management; Renewable Energy Resources; Technology; Investments,Accounting methods; Alternative energy technologies; Conceptual model; Conventional energy sources; Economic crisis; Energy productions; Global energy; Investment decision making; Investment decisions; Investment portfolio; Policy makers; Renewable energy fields; Renewable energy technologies; Societal benefits; Status quo; Technological diversification; Decision making; Economics; Industrial management; Renewable energy resources; Technology; Investments,,"Awerbuch, Shimon, Investing in photovoltaics: Risk, accounting and the value of new technology, Energy Policy, 28, 14, pp. 1023-1035, (2000); Awerbuch, Shimon, Exploiting the oil-GDP effect to support renewables deployment, Energy Policy, 34, 17, pp. 2805-2819, (2006); Analytical Methods for Energy Diversity and Security, (2007); Paris International Energy Agency, (2003); Prospect Theory and Asset Prices, (1999); Barberis, Nicholas C., A model of investor sentiment, Journal of Financial Economics, 49, 3, pp. 307-343, (1998); Bendoly, Elliot, Incorporating behavioral theory in OM empirical models, Journal of Operations Management, 24, 6, pp. 735-736, (2006); Benartzi, Shlomo, Myopic loss aversion and the equity premium puzzle, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 110, 1, pp. 73-92, (1995); Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences an Integrated Approach to Research Design Measurement and Statistics, (1999); Behavioral Foundations of Strategic Management, (2005)",,,National Science Technology and Innovation Policy Office (STI); Siam Cement Group (SCG); Bangkok Bank; CAT Telecom; Western Digital,,1890843229; 9781890843229,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78549277758,

It is meant to bring economic growth and solve a range of social, cultural and humanitarian problems. However, there are significant debates in relation to the extent that the reality of globalisation reflects this idealized vision. In particular, globalisation has produced a highly interdependent world, rendering state boundaries meaningless and challenging the ideology and limits of certain areas of international law. This book will provide the opportunity to address some of the multifaceted issues provoked by the issue of globalisation. The book is an exploration of the intricate nexus that emerges as a result of globalisation, inextricably linking together issues of international law, human rights, environmental law and international trade law. Bringing together a number of experts in the field, the book focuses on the areas of social justice and environmental justice, and explores the links that exists between the two and the effect of globalisation on these areas. A variety of topics are addressed throughout the chapters of this book - including biodiversity, the law of the sea, biotechnology, child labour, the rights of women, corporate social responsibility, terrorism and counter-terrorism, water resources, intellectual property rights and the role of non-government organisations. As globalisation has many facets and actors, the contributions to the book engage with interdisciplinary research to deal with the various challenges identified, and critically explore both the potential of globalisation as a vehicle of sustainable and equitable development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Still Sapping the Poor A Critique of IMF Poverty Reduction Strategies, (2000); Acker, Joan, Gender, Capitalism and Globalization, Critical Sociology, 30, 1, pp. 17-41, (2004); Practice and Procedure of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, (2000); Environmental Law, (2008); Journal of International Affairs, (1992); Mcgill Law Journal, (2006); Child Labour in Bangladesh, (1991); Alam, Shawkat, Tragedy of gas and coal exploration in Bangladesh: Towards ensuring corporate environmental accountability, Asia Pacific Journal of Environmental Law, 12, 1, pp. 117-148, (2009); Allen, Michael H., Globalization and peremptory norms in international law: From Westphalian to global constitutionalism?, International Politics, 41, 3, pp. 341-353, (2004); Eunomia New Order for A New World, (1990)",,Taylor and Francis,,,9780415499101; 9781136866968,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84917263792,

This potential manifests in two ways. First, it evidences the relationship between the banking industry and climate change by focusing on three hallmarks of banking business, namely risk assessment, financing and profiteering. Secondly, it shows how banks in their role as creditors, investors, advisers and heads of supply chains can influence the business practices and greenhouse gas emissions of other corporate actors. Thirdly, it contends that exponential corporate emissions reductions could flow from bank practices that influence client and supplier networks in an ever-widening web.

Emission of CO<inf>2</inf> occurred during farm operations, production of farm inputs, transport, processing and preparation of food.

Mutton emitted 11.9 times as much GHG as milk, 12.1 times fish, 12.9 times rice and 36.5 times chapatti.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews various background documents preceding the implementation of CRC in order to identify the abatement incentives established. The common structure of commercial leases and the early property market reaction to CRC are also considered in order to explore how effective the CRC scheme is likely to be in achieving the twin goals of carbon saving and landlordtenant collaboration. Findings – Key to the success of the CRC scheme will be the way in which the financial and reputational drivers established by the CRC scheme incentivise landlords and tenants to make technological and social changes to reduce energy consumption. Given the variety of ways that energy is supplied to tenanted commercial property, the complexity of the CRC scheme, the traditionally adversarial relations between landlords and tenants and the “splitincentive” of commercial leases, energy abatement opportunities are found to be significantly more limited in the leasehold context than for owneroccupied properties. Nonetheless, the paper notes that the introduction of the CRC scheme has begun an important conversation and is an important step towards tackling energy efficiency. Originality/value – The paper brings together understandings of the legal framework of commercial leases, of the property market and practice, and the landlord and tenant relationship – to consider how the CRC scheme will help to deliver the UK's goal of reducing carbon emissions. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbon; Energy Consumption; Leasing; United Kingdom,,,"Biggart, Nicole Woolsey, Economic sociology and the social problem of energy inefficiency, American Behavioral Scientist, 50, 8, pp. 1070-1087, (2007); Estates Gazette, (2010); Carbon Reduction Commitment Organisational Structures, (2008); Consultation on the Draft Order to Implement the Carbon Reduction Commitment Government Response and Policy Decisions, (2009); Final Impact Assessment on the Order to Implement the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, (2010); How is the Successful Qualification of Epc Organisations Ensured, (2007); Implementation Proposals for the Carbon Reduction Commitment Report on the Public Consultation, (2008); New Law Journal, (2009); Institutional Leases in the 21st Century, (2007); Size and Structure of the Uk Property Market, (2005)",,,,17561469; 17561450,,,,English,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986105112,

Such codes can flexibly bridge the gap between individual companies' sustainability initiatives and mandatory, legal regulation. However, concerns continue to be expressed that the equator principles reporting of banks is not fully satisfactory, so the aim of this paper is to investigate both the nature of the success and the shortcomings of equator principles reporting. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on academic literature on motivations for corporate social responsibility and various publications by non-government organisations and professional accounting and legal organisations, together with analysis of the disclosures made by Barclays and HSBC. In addition, access was gained for semi-structured interviews with some senior executives/consultants. Findings: While the voluntary equator principles initiative has been remarkably successful in matching banks' strategic motivation, the environmental benefit may primarily be a by-product of the risk management processes of banks, consistent with enlightened shareholder theory. This does not mean the environmental benefits may not be real but, without more detailed project-level disclosure and a standardised performance evaluation system, it is difficult to measure the extent to which the equator principles have had a positive effect on the environment. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed to gauge how the equator principles impact front-line decision making. There could usefully be further standardisation of equator principles reporting formats, with more detail about project-level implementation. With respect to reports of external assurers, it remains an open question as to whether these should be made compulsory, subject to further specification of the independence and competence standards. Originality/value: The study helps to illuminate the effectiveness of a voluntary code such as the equator principles in the social construction of how enlightened shareholder theory is to be interpreted and implemented.

They are crucial in determining whether society - from governments to individual consumers - succeeds in following an environmentally sustainable path. However, those working in the financial sector are largely unaware of the rationale and pressures for sustainable development and its bearing on their work, while those in the relevant research and policy areas commonly overlook how vital the financial sector is for progress. Marcel Jeucken sets out to rectify this state of affairs, in a style which is accessible to those with no experience of environmental finance issues. He provides a comprehensive account of their interdependence: why the financial sector is crucial to achieving sustainability and why the triple bottom line of commercial, environmental and social success points the way forward for banking. From a systematic assessment of major banks around the world, he presents a comprehensive account of current best practice, an analysis of the differences in approach and performance, and recommendations of actions and policies for improved performance that will contribute to sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Recycling Een Zorg Minder Voor Het Milieu, (1989); Milieu Een Hele Onderneming, (1990); Milieuverslag 1994 1997, (1998); Environment Report 1998 2000, (2001); Lokale Economie Wereldwijd, (1998); Capitalismo Contra Capitalismo, (1991); Allen, Franklin, The theory of financial intermediation, Journal of Banking and Finance, 21, 11-12, pp. 1461-1485, (1997); undefined, (1993); Realising the Business Value of Sustainable Development, (2000); Asian Environmental Outlook 2001, (2000)",,Taylor and Francis Inc.,,,9781849776264; 1853837660; 9781853837661,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071518903,

This paper argues that there can be significant tensions between these goals, and that SRI (and indeed all investment) should not allow the pursuit of maximizing investment returns to prevail over an ethical agenda of promoting social and economic justice and environmental protection. The discourse on SRI has changed dramatically in recent years to the point where its capacity to promote social emancipation, sustainable development and other ethical goals is in jeopardy. Historically, SRI was a boutique sector of the market dominated by religious-based investors who sought to invest in accordance with the tenets of their faith. From the early 1970s, the aspirations of the SRI movement morphed significantly in the context of the divestment campaign against South Africas apartheid regime. No longer were social investors satisfied with just avoiding profit from immoral activities; instead, they also sought to change the behavior of others. Business case SRI is a problematic SRI benchmark for several reasons: often there is a countervailing business case for financing irresponsible activities, given the failure of markets to capture all social and environmental externalities; secondly, even if investors care about such concerns, there may be no means of financially quantifying their significance for investment purposes; and, thirdly, even if such factors can be financially quantified, they may be deemed to be such long-term financial costs or benefits that they become discounted and ignored. The ethics case for SRI and ethical business practices more generally takes the view that both investors and the companies they fund have ethical responsibilities that trump the pursuit of profit maximization. Ethical investment should be grounded on this foundation. However, it may not be enough. To keep ethical investment ethical will likely require institutionalizing new norms and governance standards, in such domains as reforming fiduciary duties and the internal governance of financial organizations.

For companies that invest in, develop, own, or operate commercial real estate assets, this awareness of extrafinancial impacts has led to a significant interest in what has been called responsible property investment (RPI). Within the field of RPI, green real estate - real estate investment and management that seeks to reduce the environmental impacts of building construction and operations - has begun to receive attention. This attention has been extended over the past decade to community property development projects, where both social and environmental considerations related not only to the building, but also the project site and surrounding community are integrated into management and investment decisions. Some examples of these projects include affordable and workforce housing, urban revitalization and brownfield redevelopment. More social-focussed issues such as labour and workplace considerations are also key components of responsible property investing, yet to date labour issues have received little attention in the RPI literature and workplace considerations are reflected indirectly through environmental considerations in the green building literature. This paper explores responsible real estate investment in Canada by taking an integrated approach in examining both environmental and social factors and their potential impact on such investments. A series of semi-structured interviews are conducted with key stakeholders in Canada to gain insight into how using environmental and social factors may influence long-term risk and financial returns in real estate investment in Canada with particular emphasis on institutional investors engaged in these practices. Data is used to analyse the impact that ESG considerations have on financial performance of these assets.

On the one hand, leaving environmental protection to the free market, relying on notions of corporate social responsibility and altruistic consumer and shareholder preferences, will not deliver optimal results. On the other hand, nationalizing the delivery of environmental protection is likely to fail because nation states rarely have the depth and quality of information required to instruct all the relevant agents to make appropriate decisions. Thus, as for many areas of policy, appropriate models of environmental intervention will lie between these two extremes. While it is impossible to specify general rules concerning the precise form of intervention, in part because the type of intervention depends upon value judgements, this paper sets out some of the considerations that are particular to environmental policy, and explores several principles for policy design, including information, coordination, and principal-agent problems, with a particular focus on the international context. © The Author 2010.

It first explores the implications of the global economic downturn of 2008-9 for environmental policies, focusing in particular on the example of action against climate change. The arguments for and against activist fiscal policies in general are then reviewed, and the case made that a demand-induced downturn provides a very good opportunity to undertake a necessary step change in the public spending component of environmental policies and to start working through a backlog of public investment to improve the environment. Fiscal policy should be used to improve the allocation of resources across time and space. Recent fiscal stimuli are considered in the light of this discussion. It is also argued that there is little cause to delay the introduction of price signals to internalize environmental externalities. But the levels at which such signals should be set requires careful analysis; changes over the business cycle may be warranted, depending on the nature of the environmental externality and the cause(s) of the business cycle in question. © The Authors 2010.

In the recent years, China has produced a series of green policies, including green tax, green procurement, as well as green policies relevant to the financial sector, namely, green credit, insurance, and security policies. Of the three, the green credit policy is the most advanced, with three agencies (the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Peoples' Bank of China, and the China Banking Regulatory Commission) sharing the responsibility for implementation. The policy, approaching its fourth year of implementation, has proved resistant to China's massive economic upheaval following the global financial crisis. Its future success depends on effective environmental data collection and dissemination, technical guidance, and provision of true financial incentives for banks. The continued success in implementation could potentially provide China with the experience and confidence to address new challenges, such as the environmental and social conduct of its enterprises overseas. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",China; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Protection; Market-based Mechanism; Sustainable Banking; Banking; Cleanup; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Economics; Environmental Protection; Incentive; Policy Implementation; Pollution Policy; Trade-environment Relations; China,banking; cleanup; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental protection; incentive; policy implementation; pollution policy; trade-environment relations; China,,"Bank of Communication Corporation Social Responsibility Report 2008, (2009); Bndes Joins the New Green Protocol and Reiterates Its Commitment to Environmental Preservation, (2008); China S Energy and Emissions A Turning Point, (2004); Social Responsibility Report of China S Banking Sector, (2009); Guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility for Banking and Financial Institutions in China, (2009); Guidelines on Credit Granting for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Cbrc Publication Number 83, (2007); Chinese Banks Corporate Social Responsibility Report, (2009); China Construction Bank Corporation Social Responsibility Report 2008, (2009); Not of Penny Entered Energy Intensive and Highly Polluting Projects, (2010); Managing Rules on Information Disclosure by Listed Companies Csrc Publication Number 40, (2007)",,,,10704965; 15525465,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952506414,

EOC is an evolving principle for Australian business. It reflects the value and importance organizations place on their key stakeholders, their staff members, and is a vital cog in HRD systems. This article aims to define EOC for Australian business conditions, expand on the valuable contribution employee engagement and interpersonal trust can add to risk management within an organization, and illustrate how information and communication technology provides an ideal and existing platform to educate a large office-based staff about their organization's EOC program, underpinning a culture for a learning organization. Many organizations are working hard to acquire EOC status, as EOC programs are one way of addressing employee requirements. Australia has recently been through a 10-year period of low unemployment that resulted in a job seekers' market mentality, enabling employees and job seekers to look beyond monetary incentive in employment to include aligning work culture with their individual beliefs on corporate, environmental, and social responsibility. This article reviews the benefits of a more engaging process for information management with staff members on their EOC opportunities and conceptualizes a model curriculum delivered through computer-assisted learning on an organization's EOC program.

Recently, released figures for Australia, for example, suggest that agriculture, forestry, and other land-uses, which depend on healthy functioning ecosystems, could abate as much as three quarters of the country's emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was concerned primarily with ecosystems and humankind, but the Kyoto Protocol of the Convention forfeited the potential of using agriculture, forestry, and other land-uses for global climate mitigation. This had the effect of decoupling biodiversity and ecosystems from carbon pollution reduction and climate change considerations. The Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, one of the first emission trading schemes in the world to follow Kyoto ""rules,"" excludes the agriculture, forestry, and other land-use sector, apart from plantation reforestation, potentially creating perverse incentives that themselves can turn into threatening ecological processes. We use Australia and its emerging emissions trading scheme as a case study of the potential effects of this decoupling, and demonstrate the potential impacts on a landscape-scale regional greenhouse gas abatement and carbon sequestration project. ©2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Afforestation; Agriculture; Carbon Trading; Convention On Biological Diversity; Copenhagen; Deforestation; Kyoto; Redd,,,"undefined, (2008); undefined, (2009); Australia State of the Environment 2001, (2006); A Document of the Unep Finance Initiative Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Work Stream Besw, (2008); Bradshaw, Corey J.A., Urgent preservation of boreal carbon stocks and biodiversity, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 24, 10, pp. 541-548, (2009); Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia Ibra, (2004); Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 Commentary, (2009); Dale, Allan, Integrating Effort for Regional Natural Resource Outcomes: The Wet Tropics Experience, pp. 398-410, (2009); Regional Resource Use Planning in Rangelands an Australian Review, (1998); National Carbon Accounting Toolbox, (2005)",,,,1755263X,,,,English,Article,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957657606,

It describes the main challenges and opportunities for Asian countries making the transition towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. The main challenge for Asian economies is to address the unsustainable consumption patterns of urban consumers, which entails a policy shift from the current focus on pollution and inefficient industrial production. In view of future consumption trends and the global convergence of consumption patterns, the characteristics of the emerging 'global consumer class' are examined, with particular focus on urban ecological footprints and carbon emissions. Furthermore, the difference between urban and rural consumption is discussed, together with opportunities for low-carbon urban development in the megacities of Asian developing countries.

This ascendancy has in no small measure been associated with the uptake of United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) as a de facto standard for mainstream responsible investment. This article contributes to this disquiet. It does this by examining how egoist 'responsible' investors (as endorsed by the PRI) might have behaved had they been around in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s during days of the anti-apartheid socially responsible investment (SRI) movement. Armed with near perfect (hindsight grade) enhanced analytics, it is clear that the signals that such egoist 'responsible' investors would have sent to company management in terms of the apartheid issue would have been highly muddled and therefore ineffective. The net conclusion is that there is nothing inherently or inevitably 'responsible' about egoist investment and that the aversion to behaving ethically amongst institutional investors must be challenged and not swept under a carpet of rhetoric. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Egoist Investors; Ethical Investment; Principles For Responsible Investment; Responsible Investment; Socially Responsible Investment,,,"A Legal Framework for the Integration of Environmental Social and Governance Issues into Institutional Investment, (2005); Tipping Point, (2000); Hardin, Garrett J., The tragedy of the commons, Science, 162, 3859, pp. 1243-1248, (1968); Hawley, James P., The universal owner's role in sustainable economic development, pp. 216-225, (2017); Jensen, Michael C., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure, Journal of Financial Economics, 3, 4, pp. 305-360, (1976); Kumar, Raman, The End of South African Sanctions, Institutional Ownership, and the Stock Price Performance of Boycotted Firms: Evidence on the Impact of Social/Ethical Investing, Business and Society, 41, 2, pp. 133-165, (2002); Mackenzie, Craig, The scope for investor action on corporate social and environmental impacts, pp. 20-38, (2017); Statement of the President of the African National Congress Nelson Mandela at the United Nations, (1993); McWilliams, Abagail, Event studies in management research: Theoretical and empirical issues, Academy of Management Journal, 40, 3, pp. 626-657, (1997); Academy of Management Journal, (1994)",,,,01674544; 15730697,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955276326,

Additionally, the community expects socially and environmentally responsible behaviour practices; the so-called triple bottom line approach. The paper briefly reviews the development of corporate social responsibility reporting from the perspective of two large Australian banks and attempts to understand their motivation for voluntary disclosure. Stakeholder theory and game theory provide a means to analyse why banks undertake CSR reporting. The paper compares Westpac and National Australia Bank's CSR reporting over the period 2004-2005 utilising external rating agencies and CSR reports to determine the extent of disclosure in relation to employees, environment, community and customers. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pros and cons of CSR, the role of regulation and recommendations for future policy direction. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Banks; Corporate Governance; Government Policy And Regulation,,,"Adams, Carol A., Internal organisational factors influencing corporate social and ethical reporting: Beyond current theorising, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 15, 2, pp. 223-250, (2002); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); An Appraisal of Socially Responsible Investments and Implications for Trustees and Other Investment Fiduciaries, (2002); Advances in Public Interest Accounting, (1990); Auger, Pat, What will Consumers Pay for Social Product Features?, Journal of Business Ethics, 42, 3, pp. 281-304, (2003); False Profits how Australia S Finance Sector Undervalues the Environment, (2006); Towards Transparency Progress on Global Sustainability Reporting 2004, (2004); Barricades and Boardrooms A Contemporary History of the Corporate Accountability Movement, (2004); Social Responsibilities of the Businessman, (1953); Gri Guidelines to Standardise Sustainability Reports, (2007)",,Virtus Interpress alex_kostyuk@VirtusInterPress.org,,17279232; 18103057,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897148492,

It is argued that adaptation to and mitigation of climate change will be required to avert or reduce adverse impacts. Governments are developing climate change adaptation (CCA) strategies. The business community is also stirring to the need to adapt to as well as mitigate climate change, but progress has been slow, particularly in the case of adaptation. This paper explores emerging perceptions of the need for adaptation and some initial adaptation actions within a 'business as usual' economic mode of operation. It also identifies constraints to further action among a cross-section of actors in the business community in South Africa. Data from semi-structured interviews and scrutiny of reports reveals that there are a number of constraints preventing business from engaging more fully in CCA. These findings correspond with findings in other business-sector and CCA studies. They include: issues of terminology (adaptation versus risk management); uncertainty over climate-change projections and scenarios; and concerns about how such information can be used effectively in decision making, particularly long-term business planning. Despite these challenges, some potential synergies between policy, planning and the business community for promoting adaptation are suggested. © 2009 Earthscan. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Business Sector; Climate Change; Opportunities; Risk Management; Business; Climate Change; Environmental Economics; Mitigation; Risk Assessment; Sustainable Development; South Africa,business; climate change; environmental economics; mitigation; risk assessment; sustainable development; South Africa,,"A Changing Climate for Insurance A Summary Report for Chief Executives and Policymakers, (2004); Climate Change 2007 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2007); Focussing on A Sustainable Future, (2007); Archer, Emma Rosa Mary, Identifying underserved end-user groups in the provision of climate information, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 84, 11, pp. 1525-1472, (2003); Business Case for Early Action, (2006); Insurance Related Options for Adaptation to Climate Change, (2005); Exploring Sustainability Science A Southern African Perspective, (2008); As Yet Untitled Paper on Mechanisms for Private Sector Engagement in Climate Change Adaptation, (2008); Adaptation to Climate Change International Policy Options, (2006); Adaptive Governance Integrating Science Policy and Decision Making, (2005)",,,,17565537; 17565529,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857714374,

Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses that the climate change, natural resource shortages, fuel crisis and global financial crisis, etc. will not go away just because there is a recession. In this regard, Shari’ah compliant finance has a broader responsibility to consider societal goals and should be preparing for the post-credit crunch world. The paper evaluates the performance of Shari’ah compliant sustainable funds using the traditional measures of performance in relation to risk-adjusted benchmarks to see if there is any ethical effect. Findings – The paper advocates that preventing future market meltdowns and avoiding catastrophic climate change requires a new era of longterism in Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The study assesses the performance of the Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The result shows that Shari’ah compliant funds outperformed the conventional benchmark and therefore, the challenge for Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing is not to become like conventional investing but, rather, to replace. Research limitations/implications – Shari’ah compliant sustainable finance is a recent phenomena and therefore, rigorous analytical predication of Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing variables are at present not possible using evolutionary and complex system approaches; however, such system can be fruitfully studied in future through simulation methods and certain types of econometric modeling when the long-term data will be made available. Originality/value – As the credit crunch has evolved into a full-blown economic crisis, many have turned to the Shari’ah compliant finance to provide a route map out of recession. With an increasing number of conventional banks and corporations struggling to find funds to support their businesses, Shari’ah compliant financial institutions represent a potential solution to bridge the liquidity gap in the global markets. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Economic Sustainability; Investments; Islam; Natural Resources; Recession,,,"Eurekahedge, (2007); Blackburn, Robin, A global pension plan, New Left Review, 47, pp. 71-92, (2007); undefined, (2009); Crossing the River, (1993); Economists, (2009); undefined, (2007); Carbon 100 Quantifying the Carbon Emissions Intensities and Exposures of the Ftse 100, (2005); Energy Technology Perspectives, (2008); Working Capital Report Unep Fi Geneva, (2007); Sustainable Investing the Art of Long Term Performance, (2008)",,,,08288666,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993029190,

Design/methodology/approach: A search is conducted for relevant indicator data sources using internet, library and government resources. Priority is placed on information that could be accessed on line, by any user, free of charge, from reputable sources, using available search parameters, for all types of properties and for any properties anywhere in the USA. Useful sources are identified and assessed using data quality indicators. Information gaps are also identified. A previously published method is adapted for comparing the social and environmental performance of properties and portfolios and data collected from identified sources are used to illustrate the construction of indices useful for making comparisons. Findings: Nationwide data sources are available for most important dimensions with greater availability for the most important ones. There are, however, important data gaps related to such issues as water use, day light and ventilation, aesthetics and others. Most sources only require a property address for queries but do not support batch processing. There are no data quality problems for most data sources but a substantial minority of the sources does have at least one data quality issue. Available data can be used to construct indices useful for comparing properties and portfolios. Practical implications: Fund managers can use these results to compile extra-financial information on sustainability and corporate social responsibility and socially responsible investors can use them to evaluate investment opportunities. Originality/value: This is the first effort to identify and assess data sources needed for creating responsible and sustainable metrics and indices and responds to demand for better metrics in the field of sustainable and responsible property investing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Corporate Social Responsibility; Investments; Property; Sustainable Development; United States Of America,,,"Real Estate and Socially Responsible Investment New Products New Investments New Value, (2007); Atkinson, Giles D., Measuring corporate sustainability, Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 43, 2, pp. 235-252, (2000); Bebbington, Jan, Accounting technologies and sustainability assessment models, Ecological Economics, 61, 2-3, pp. 224-236, (2007); Bonacchi, Massimiliano, Dartboards and clovers as new tools in sustainability planning and control, Business Strategy and the Environment, 16, 7, pp. 461-473, (2007); Boyd, Terry P., Assessing the triple bottom line impact on commercial buildings, (2005); Proceedings of the Pacific Rim Real Estate Society Prres Conference, (2005); Pacific Rim Real Estate Society Conference, (2005); Brown, Judy A., Approaches and perspectives in social and environmental accounting: An overview of the conceptual landscape, Business Strategy and the Environment, 15, 2, pp. 103-117, (2006); Dahlsrud, Alexander, How corporate social responsibility is defined: An analysis of 37 definitions, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 15, 1, pp. 1-13, (2008); Eco Management and Auditing, (2001)",,,,1463578X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349653191,

Indirectly, by regulating greenhouse gases the legal system is helping to create a business case for investors to respond to climate change threats.

The second reason is that uncontrolled production, distribution, and use of conventional energy may lead to environmental degradation and global warming.

In an era of global financial markets, the financial sector has a crucial impact on the state of the environment. The long-standing movement for ethically and socially responsible investment (SRI) has recently begun to advocate environmental standards for financiers. While this movement is gaining more adherents, it has increasingly justified responsible financing as a path to be prosperous, rather than virtuous. This trend partly owes to how financial institutions view their legal responsibilities. The business case motivations that now predominantly drive SRI are not sufficient to make the financial sector a means to sustainable development. Some modest legal reforms to improve the quality and extent of SRI have yet to make a tangible difference. A more ambitious strategy to promote SRI for environmental sustainability is possible, based on reforming the fiduciary duties of financial institutions. Such duties, tied to concrete performance standards, could make financiers invest in more ethically responsible ways.

To assist in decisionmaking, external valuations are regularly commissioned. The purpose of this paper is to examine the practical difficulties associated with incorporating sustainability criteria in the valuation methodology as valuation outcomes inform CRE decisionmaking at strategic and tactical levels. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes the form of a detailed and critical literature review. Findings It is widely acknowledged that sustainability has become a key driver of many business decisions. Corporate entities can achieve a considerable range of tangible and intangible benefits from sustainable real estate in their freehold portfolios. While substantial progress has been made toward understanding the dynamics of the sustainable real estate market, the valuation of such assets is rather hampered by the comparative difficulties in achieving consensus regarding the sustainable criteria and how they should be objectively assessed. Originality/value The paper contributes to the broader appreciation of the theoretical and practical difficulties associated with identifying and assessing appropriate sustainable criteria. Importantly, the paper highlights the need for greater understanding of the criteria in the evolving valuation methodology framework. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Decision Making; Real Estate; Sustainable Development,,,"Andrew, Anthony, Property depreciation in Government, Journal of Property Investment and Finance, 24, 3, pp. 259-263, (2006); Appel-Meulenbroek, Rianne, CRE effects on organizational performance: measurement tools for management, Journal of Corporate Real Estate, 9, 4, pp. 218-238, (2007); Bartlett, Ed, Informing the decision makers on the cost and value of green building, Building Research and Information, 28, 5-6, pp. 315-324, (2000); Property Investment Depreciation and Obsolescence, (1991); Depreciation in Commercial Property Markets, (2005); Causes and Effects of Depreciation on Office Buildings A Ten Year Update, (1999); Triple Bottom Line Approach to Property Performance Evaluation, (2006); undefined, (2005); Sustainability in the Corporate Real Estate Industry Perceptions and Trends, (2007); A Business Case for Green Buildings in Canada A Report for Industry Canada, (2005)",,,,14791048; 1463001X,,,,English,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993087841,

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on a combination of in-depth interviews with non-governmental organization (NGO) leaders, extensive documentary analysis and participant observation in order to understand and explain, from an NGO perspective, the use of the Equator Principles as a central element in an attempt to legitimise financial institutions' project finance activities. Key aspects of legitimacy theory are used to theoretically frame the analysis. Findings: The paper reveals and analyses the process through which campaigning NGOs conferred a nominal level of legitimacy on financial institutions' project finance activities. It proceeds to unveil how and why this attained legitimacy unravelled. A perceived lack of accountability at an institutional, organisational and individual project level is identified as a central reason for this reduction in legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: The paper primarily focuses on one side of the story of the dynamics of the legitimation process underpinning the evolution of the Equator Principles until 2006. Future research could focus on obtaining and theorising financial institution perspectives on the Equator Principles' development, implementation, and progression as well as analysing developments beyond 2006. Originality/value: The paper advances our understanding of the dynamics of legitimation processes. These dynamics are studied from the perspective of a key ""relevant public"" thereby prioritising perceptions that are largely absent from corporate social accountability research seeking to empirically inform legitimacy theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Benchmarking; Corporate Social Responsibility; Financial Institutions; Non-governmental Organizations; Stakeholder Analysis,,,"Equator Principles A Step Towards Sustainability, (2005); Organization Science, (1990); Good Faith Good Practice Implementation and Accountability of the Equator Principles, (2003); No U Turn Allowed Recommendations to the Equator Banks, (2004); Principles Profits or Just PR Triple P Investments Under the Equator Principles, (2004); Transparency and the Equator Principles Proposals for the EP Bank Disclosure Working Document, (2004); Unproven Equator Principles A Banktrack Statement, (2005); Unproven Principles the Equator Principles at Year Two, (2005); Statement on the New Version of the Equator Principles, (2006); Do S and Don Ts of Sustainable Banking A Bank Track Manual, (2006)",,,,09513574,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69349092001,

Therefore, as a community in the global village, it is an institution of accountability, which in turn is dependent on honesty and trust (Lee, 1995). The intention of this conceptual paper is to provide discourse that induces questions for reflection in the call for values underpinning the integrity and ethical stance of the profession.

We start with the commonly held view that firm competitiveness is defined by the market. That is, the question of what are the critical competitiveness factors is answered by looking at how companies and financial analysts describe and evaluate a firm. To analyze this, we review the current state of the art on the relationship between CSR and competitiveness. Second, CSR criteria used by financial analysts is identified and compared with company valuation methods. Third, the results of a multi-stakeholder dialogue on CSR and competitiveness of the European financial sector are presented. As a conclusion, we argue that CSR and competitiveness relate through a learning and innovation cycle, where corporate values, policies and practices are permanently defined and re-defined. Thus, we propose that learning takes place as CSR is embedded in business processes, and that once it has been integrated, in turn, it generates innovative practices, and finally, competitiveness. At the end of the paper, we propose that CSR in practice consists of managing inherent paradoxes generated by the tension between CSR and business policies. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Competitiveness; Corporate Reputation; Corporate Social Responsibility; Organizational Strategy; Paradox; Responsible Competitiveness,,,"Singapore Management Review, (2004); Academy of Management Review, (1989); Ayuso, Silvia, Responsible competitiveness at the ""micro"" level of the firm - Using stakeholder dialogue as a source for new ideas: A dynamic capability underlying sustainable innovation, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 6, 4, pp. 475-490, (2006); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Why companies go green: A model of ecological responsiveness, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 4, pp. 717-736, (2000); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Principles of Corporate Finance, (2000); Budd, Leslie, Conceptual framework for regional competitiveness, Regional Studies, 38, 9, pp. 1015-1028, (2004); Special Report the 100 Top Brands, (2007); Special Report the World S Most Innovative Companies, (2007); Business and Human Rights Mapping International Standards of Responsibility and Accountability for Corporate Acts, (2007)",,,,01674544; 15730697,,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349257872,

It argues that while such governance is commonly seen in terms of a tragedy of the commons arising out of the anarchy of the interstate system, it is more fruitful to analyse these dynamics in relation to a conception of global capitalism. While efforts to govern global environmental problems started out as attempts to regulate the side-effects of existing forms of capitalist development, they have increasingly been organised to channel capitalism in novel directions. This chapter begins by arguing for this way of understanding global environmental governance in general and charts the shifts in the way that governance regarding the environment has related to trends within the organisation of global capitalism. It then outlines the ways in which contemporary governance can be understood to be pursuing sustainable capitalism. It explores this latter theme focusing primarily on climate politics, both as the most prominent element in contemporary global environmental governance, but also as a key test of the extent to which ‘governing for sustainable development’ can be regarded as being on a successful path. It argues that the key mechanisms that have emerged to promote this sustainable capitalism are those directly working to create new sites of market activity (specifically emissions trading regimes), those seeking to expand market access across the globe (such as the Clean Development Mechanism), and those seeking to shape investment behaviour by large institutional investors (such as the Carbon Disclosure Project). © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Allen, Myles R., The blame game, Nature, 432, 7017, pp. 551-552, (2004); Bachram, Heidi, Climate fraud and carbon colonialism: The new trade in greenhouse gases, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 15, 4, pp. 5-20, (2004); Clean Development Mechanism, (2000); Compromise of Liberal Environmentalism, (2001); Cop6 can Position on the Clean Development Mechanism Sustainable Development and Emissions Reductions, (2000); Jagers, Sverker Carlsson, Climate Governance beyond the State, Global Governance, 9, 3, pp. 385-399, (2003); Cashore, Benjamin W., Governing through markets: Forest certification and the emergence of non-state authority, pp. 1-327, (2004); Earth Brokers Power Politics and World Development, (1994); Clapp, Jennifer A., The privatization of global environmental governance: ISO 14000 and the developing world, Global Governance, 4, 3, pp. 295-316, (1998); Production Power and World Order Social Forces in the Making of History, (1987)",,Cambridge University Press,,,9780521518758; 9780511807756,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923407140,

Rarely are the ""unseen polluters"", the financial institutions that fund and profit from eco-damaging corporations put at the forefront of the environmental debate. By focusing on these unseen polluters, this book provides a comprehensive examination of the response of the movement for socially responsible investment (SRI) and its current regulation worldwide. It finds that in recent years SRI has shifted away from its traditions of ethical investment to a business case approach, whereby social and environmental issues are addressed largely only if they are perceived as ""financial material"" to investors. Further, the contemporary SRI movement lacks sufficient influence in financial markets to provide a viable framework of governance to offset the deficiencies and gaps in official regulation. In offering a guide to possible reform to ensure that the financial sector prioritizes ethically-based investments, this book proposes greater regulatory supervision of SRI. It suggests that new governmental reforms should provide financiers with a better mix of economic incentives and informational resources. More importantly, it also argues for redefining the fiduciary responsibilities of institutional investors to incorporate environmental concern. Through these and other measures, the book posits that corporate financiers, including banks, mutual funds and pension plans, will be more accountable to the goals of achieving environmentally sustainable development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Environmental Law; Ethics; Financial Markets; Investment; Sustainable Development,,,"Financial Regulation Why how and Where Now, (1998); Structure and Regulation of Financial Markets, (2000); Uk Social Investment Forum Tells Mps of Need to Include Environment in Framework for Financial Services Regulator, (1999); Insurance Solvency Supervision OECD Country Profiles, (2002); Masciandaro, Donato M., Unification in financial sector supervision: The trade-off between central bank and single authority, Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance, 12, 2, pp. 151-169, (2004); Rules and Regulators, (1997); An Introduction to the Law on Financial Investment, (2005); Banking Act, (1933); Stanford Journal of Law Business and Finance, (1995); Survey of Investment Regulations of Pension Funds, (2006)",,Oxford University Press,,,9780195333459; 9780199868827,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922893337,

As a result, practitioners and scholars have begun focusing on the social responsibility and sustainability of property investors. This paper expands that work by examining Responsible Property Investing among investment organizations in the United States. Responsible Property Investing is defined as efforts that go beyond compliance with minimum legal requirements to better manage the environmental, social, and governance issues associated with property investing. A survey of senior American executives finds that most organizations are going beyond compliance, implementing management strategies and investing in properties that are consistent with Responsible Property Investment principles. Most executives also place their organization beyond compliance in a Responsible Property Investing stage model. Business concerns are the leading drivers and impediments. Among the various types of organizations studied, pension funds, foundations and endowments lag behind others in implementing Responsible Property Investing.

Some evidence is drawn from the United Kingdom, which has wide insurance coverage for weather perils and much familiarity with international catastrophe insurance. The author believes there is good ground to argue that climate change is already affecting the risks, although it is not the only factor that has caused change. Further, the risks of extremes may be changing very rapidly. Introduction: The insurance industry is affected by climate change in a number of ways, although the effects may vary greatly between jurisdictions, owing to industry structure and practice as well as to climatic and geographical differences. Insurers are already encountering aggravated claims for insured property damage in extreme events, particularly floods, storms, and droughts. As yet, the main causes of the trend of rising property claims in recent decades are socioeconomic rather than climatic; however, the contribution of climatic change could rise quickly, owing to the strongly nonlinear relationship between climatic variables and damage, and the fact that a small shift in mean conditions can create a large change in extremes. The pace of change regarding weather extremes is fast. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Insurance; Catastrophe Insurance; Climatic Changes; Climatic Variables; Industry Structures; Insurance Coverages; Insurance Industry; Strongly Nonlinear; Weather Extremes; Climate Change,Insurance; Catastrophe insurance; Climatic changes; Climatic variables; Industry structures; Insurance coverages; Insurance industry; Strongly nonlinear; Weather extremes; Climate change,,"Climate Change and Insurance an Agenda for Action in the United States, (2006); Subsidence A Global Perspective, (2000); Investing in Social Responsibility Risks and Opportunities, (2001); Vulnerability of Uk Property to Windstorm Damage, (2003); Risk Returns and Responsibility, (2004); A Changing Climate for Insurance A Summary Report for Chief Executives and Policymakers, (2004); Financial Risks of Climate Change, (2009); Coastal Flood Risk Thinking for Tomorrow Acting Today, (2006); Special Focus Energy Markets After Katrina and Rita and how to Invest, (2005); Impact of Changing Weather Patterns on Property Insurance, (1994)",,Cambridge University Press,,,9780511535840; 9780521870283,,,English,Book chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927972810,

The recent overemphasis on the business case for voluntary environmental and social activities of organisations is undermining the attention to other drivers such as legitimacy concerns. Previous literature has discussed how the principle of legitimacy may underpin corporate environmental and social performance providing motives for managers to pursue corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. In this article, we tried to advance questions that relate more to how CSR activities could potentially influence legitimation efforts of organisations. We focused on two main issues. The first is how CSR activities play into the different legitimation efforts of organisations at cognitive and socio-political levels. The second issue identifies potential variations in organisational choices of CSR activities as legitimation efforts and the conditions that influence these differences as constructs for further empirical research. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Businesses; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Environmental And Social Licence To Operate; Establishing; Legitimacy Theory; Maintaining And Repairing Legitimacy,,,"Adams, Carol A., Corporate social reporting practices in western europe: Legitimating corporate behaviour?, British Accounting Review, 30, 1, pp. 1-21, (1998); Academy of Management Review, (1994); Asa Adjudications Shell International Ltd, (2008); Organization Science, (1990); Society and Business Review, (2008); Campbell, John L., Institutional analysis and the paradox of corporate social responsibility, American Behavioral Scientist, 49, 7, pp. 925-938, (2006); Looking for A Quick Fix how Weak Social Auditing is Keeping Workers in Sweatshops, (2005); Deegan, Craig Michael, Introduction: The legitimising effect of social and environmental disclosures – a theoretical foundation, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 15, 3, pp. 282-311, (2002); Deegan, Craig Michael, Do Australian companies report environmental news objectively?: An analysis of environmental disclosures by firms prosecuted successfully by the Environmental Protection Authority, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 9, 2, pp. 50-67, (1996); Valkommen Till Paradiset, (2008)",,Inderscience Publishers,,17562546; 17562538,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052004822,

SSIs exist mostly in geographical clusters and many of them are highly energy-intensive. Their survival and growth needs efficient use of energy, a key input in their operations. Empirical studies on energy use and related issues like environmental impact, energy conservation potential, and the consequences of higher energy efficiency on SSIs are rare. This paper analyses energy consumption and associated issues in the textile dyeing cluster of Tirupur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The energy consumption pattern showed dominance of biomass. Air pollution and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions were estimated using standard, international emission factors by fuel and technology used. The importance of energy among the inputs was established by estimating the Cobb-Douglas production function which indicated energy as the second most important input. There was a statistically significant association of energy efficiency with all the economic performance indicators adopted in the study. Overall, it appears that energy-efficient firms are also likely to perform better on the economic front and hence experience higher returns to scale. The outcome of this study underscores the value of enhancing energy efficiency in SSI clusters, providing multiple benefits and ultimately contributing to sustainable development. © 2008 International Energy Initiative, Inc. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Energy Efficiency; Production Function; Returns To Scale; Textile Dyeing; Dyeing; Economics; Energy Utilization; Environmental Impact; Industrial Economics; Planning; Sustainable Development; Textiles; Cobb-douglas Production Function; Efficient Use Of Energy; Geographical Clusters; Production Function; Returns To Scale; Small Scale Industries; Small Scale Industry Clusters; Textile Dyeing; Energy Efficiency; Atmospheric Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Empirical Analysis; Energy Efficiency; Energy Use; Environmental Impact; Industrial Production; Power Generation; Returns To Scale; Small Scale Industry; Sustainable Development; Textile Industry; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Tamil Nadu; Tirupur,Dyeing; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Industrial economics; Planning; Sustainable development; Textiles; Cobb-Douglas production function; Efficient use of energy; Geographical clusters; Production function; Returns to scale; Small scale industries; Small scale industry clusters; Textile Dyeing; Energy efficiency; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental impact; industrial production; power generation; returns to scale; small scale industry; sustainable development; textile industry; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Tamil Nadu; Tirupur,,"Knitwear Industry in Tirupur, (2002); Vijay Times English Daily, (2004); Econometrica, (1960); Micro Small and Medium Enterprises A Collection of Published Data, (2007); Reduction of Ghg Potential of Knitwear Industry in Tirupur, (2003); undefined, (2001); Revised Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Volume III Reference Manual, (1996); Promotion of Energy and Water Conservation Concepts in the Turkish Textile Industry Monograph of Energy Systems and Environmental, (1997); Research Methodology Methods and Techniques, (2004); Report of the Expert Committee on Small Enterprises Chaired by Abid Hussain, (1997)",,Elsevier,,09730826; 23524669,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549164610,

In terms of underwriting, on one scenario, the economic cost of weather losses could reach over 1 trillion USD in a single year by 2040. The impacts will be worse in developing countries. The private sector needs to work with the public sector, as part of a triple dividend approach that coordinates adaptation, disaster management and sustainable economic development. For asset management the indirect impacts are key. Greenhouse gas emissions have to drop by 60 per cent by 2050, which means transforming the energy economy. Finance for renewables will reach 100 billion USD a year soon.

The article presents a detailed case study of oil and gas development offshore of Sakhalin in the Russian Far East. The study serves to illustrate the complexity of resource peripheries and to demonstrate how a critical approach to resource geographies aids economic geographic theorization of globalization. The case study focuses on how the 'greening' of global project financing has created a means by which environmental non-governmental organizations hold the international oil companies to account. The article describes the transnational advocacy network that has developed to protest against the Sakhalin-II project. The key issues are identified and the response of the operator, Sakhalin Energy, is considered. Finally, the recent actions of the Russian Government in relation to the environmental impacts of the Sakhalin-II project are examined. The article concludes by assessing the ways in which the Sakhalin case demonstrates the complex processes that construct resource peripheries and how such analyses contribute to the development of a truly global economic geography.

The results of these enquiries - a 'business as usual' approach, highlights the gap between the traditional corporate law view of short term shareholders' interests and the longer term view posited by environmental law. This paper argues that in order to achieve better corporate responsibility, there needs to be a focus on the intersections rather than the gaps between these two disciplines of law. Drawing on various sources, such as the author's earlier research on Norwegian companies and the opportunities and risks associated with climate change, the paper discusses some of these intersections and suggests the incentives that may help to move companies towards more positive environmental outcomes. © Lawbook Co. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Corporate Strategy; Environmental Legislation; Industrial Practice; Planning Practice; Australasia; Australia,climate change; corporate strategy; environmental legislation; industrial practice; planning practice; Australasia; Australia,,"Corporate Responsibility Managing Risk and Creating Value, (2006); Social Responsibility of Corporations, (2006); Our Common Future, (1987); Convention on Biological Diversity, (2008); undefined, (2008); Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, (1992); Fisher, Douglas E., Sustainability - The principle, its implementation and its enforcement, Environmental and Planning Law Journal, 18, 4, pp. 361-368, (2001); New South Wales V Commonwealth, (2006); Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, (1992); National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, (1992)",,,,0813300X,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249050861,

The aim of this article is to present the costs and benefits of interventions to reduce indoor air pollution by halving the global population currently lacking access to (1) cleaner fuels (liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)) and (2) cleaner-burning and more efficient stoves. Results are presented for 11 world subregions. Annual costs and benefits of the two interventions are modelled from 2005 until 2015. Intervention costs include fuel, stove, and programme costs, from which monetary fuel cost savings are subtracted to estimate net costs. Economic benefits include less expenditure on health care, health-related productivity gains, fuel collection and cooking time savings, and environmental impacts. Globally, annual economic benefits of halving the population without access to LPG amount to (US) $91 billion at a net cost of $13 billion. The improved stove intervention generates $105 billion in economic benefits at a negative net cost of $34 billion. The resulting benefit-cost ratios (BCR) for both interventions are favourable. The BCR for LPG ranges from 1.5 to 21.2 in rural areas, and from 2.6 to negative in urban areas. The BCR for improved stoves is negative in all sub-regions, as fuel cost savings exceed intervention costs, thus giving net negative costs. Investments in interventions to reduce indoor air pollution are potentially cost-beneficial. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Air Cleaners; Air Pollution; Coal; Cost Reduction; Costs; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Environmental Impact; Fuels; Indoor Air Pollution; Liquefied Petroleum Gas; Pollution; Pollution Control; Productivity; Stoves; Wood Fuels; Benefit Cost Ratios; Costs And Benefits; Economic Benefits; Global Population; Improved Stoves; Intervention Costs; Liquefied Petroleum Gas (lpg); Productivity Gain; Cost Benefit Analysis; Atmospheric Pollution; Burning; Combustion; Cost-benefit Analysis; Economic Impact; Environmental Economics; Environmental Impact Assessment; Indoor Air; Investment; Liquefied Petroleum Gas; Pollution Control; Urban Area,Air cleaners; Air pollution; Coal; Cost reduction; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Fuels; Indoor air pollution; Liquefied petroleum gas; Pollution; Pollution control; Productivity; Stoves; Wood fuels; Benefit cost ratios; Costs and benefits; Economic benefits; Global population; Improved stoves; Intervention costs; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Productivity gain; Cost benefit analysis; atmospheric pollution; burning; combustion; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; indoor air; investment; liquefied petroleum gas; pollution control; urban area,"We are indebted to more than 60 individuals for their assistance with this study.

Lower prices cut into pharmaceutical company profits, but improve the overall productivity and profitability of other investable sectors of the economy. This paper considers the net impact of cuts in drug prices on investor portfolios. We find that falls in pharmaceutical company profits resulting from price cuts would be largely if not fully offset by a combination of health plan cost-savings and increases in consumer spending power. Furthermore, falling drug prices benefit investors through the dynamic benefits from a healthier workforce with greater access to prescription drugs. We conclude that, from the perspective of the broadly diversified ""universal investor"", support for lower drug prices is consistent with a fiduciary duty to seek attractive long-term returns at the portfolio level.

The substance of company reports is changing, from purely environmental reporting up until 1999, to sustainability reporting (social, environmental and economic), which has become the mainstream approach of global companies. Though some of the expressed concern may be part of the discourse of political correctness, there does appear to be a significant shifting of opinion among executives. At the confluence of these multiple emerging initiatives and trends towards greater corporate social and environmental responsibility, there is emerging a dynamic stakeholder model for driving enlightened shareholder value (or more expansively, stakeholder values). This article examines how the duty to promote the success of the company offers legal encouragement to pursue responsible strategies on the part of directors and managers, and how legal and moral liability is converging.

Many underground mines use cemented backfill to provide ground support and to mitigate environmental effects associated with tailings disposal. In Ontario, mining operations contribute approximately 700,000 - 840,000 tonnes/year of CO<inf>2</inf> and Greenhouse Gas emissions to satisfy backfill cement consumption needs alone. Potential reductions of cement In backfill would significantly reduce emission of these gases and lower their adverse environmental Impacts. This paper Introduces post-consumer glass as an alternate, equally effective and lower cost binder agent strategy for backfill that may be Implemented to assist In reducing backfill energy costs; and ultimately reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions levels generated by the mining Industry. Extensive engineering testing, consisting of pipe flow loop tests and strength tests, has been Implemented In order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of process Integration within Industry. An economic analysis has demonstrated that glass is competitive In cost relative to cement and a socioeconomic study has further Indicated that the utilization of glass in mine backfill would create a new market for waste glass that reoulres less processing and reduces costs. © 2006 IEEE. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cemented Mine Backfill; Post-consumer Glass; Glass; Greenhouse Gases; Hazards; Solid Wastes; Cemented Mine Backfill; Environmental Hazards; Post Consumer Glass; Gas Emissions,Glass; Greenhouse gases; Hazards; Solid wastes; Cemented mine backfill; Environmental hazards; Post consumer glass; Gas emissions,,"Incorporation of Post Consumer Glass into Mine Backfill as A Potential Cement Substitute, (1996); Proceedings of the 98 Annual General Meeting of the Canadian Institute for Mining Metallurgy and Pettroleum, (1996); CIM Bulletin, (1994); undefined, (2008); Ghg Indicator Unep Guidelines for Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Businesses and Non Commercial Organisations, (2000); undefined, (2008); Environmental Building News, (1993)",,IEEE Computer Society,,,9781424402182; 1424402182,,,English,Conference paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549154166,

Tourism has a proven track record as a successful revenue-generating source for conservation purposes. The most common of which are protected-area entry fees, diving and yachting fees, license fees for tour operators, cruise ship passenger fees, airport taxes and hotel room taxes. The debt-for-nature swap is a financial mechanism designed to leverage funds for environmental protection through the purchase of external debt. The most common of which are the commercial debt-for-nature swap and bilateral debt conversion. Forestry conservation has become importan to those involved in the bottled water and hydropower lines of business and have been at the forefront in engaging in innovative financial arrangements to ensure watershed preservation. Additional finance for conservation and environmental protection activities is also being drawn from the innovative use of access permission, development approval and the provision of loans.

Through environmental risk management and other proactive tools, the banking sector can drive improvements in environmental management in industry and drive a move towards investment in cleaner technologies. In China, commercial banks have recently started to acknowledge the risks and opportunities associated with environmentally sustainable development.

It has been the subject of a wide-ranging debate, and is one of the central themes of the anti-globalisation movement. This book explores that debate. It argues that by focusing on the WTO, the debate has failed to recognise the institutional and discursive complexity in which the trade-environment conflict is embedded. A legal investigation of this nexus requires a framework of inquiry, in which this complexity can be elucidated - a model of global legal pluralism. The first theoretical part of the book (Chapters One and Two) responds to this challenge by developing a pluralistic model, which recognises the trade and environment conflict as the product of multiple dilemmas, constituted and negotiated by a myriad of institutional and discursive networks. As such, this conflict cannot be understood or addressed through one-dimensional models. Viewing the trade-environment conflict through a pluralistic perspective yields important practical insights. It means that this conflict cannot be resolved by uniform economic or legal formulae. Dealing with this conflict requires, rather, polycentric and contextual strategy. The empirical part of the book (Chapters Three to Seven) explicates this thesis by examining several global legal domains, ranging from the WTO to ‘private’ transnational regimes such as transnational litigation, international construction law and international financial law. This part demonstrates how the different discursive and institutional structures of these domains have influenced the contours of the trade-environment conflict, and considers the policy implications of this diversity from a pro-environmental perspective. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,"Environment Policy of the Asian Development Bank Asian Development Bank, (2002); Second World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economists, (2002); Michigan Journal of International Law, (1999); Center for International Environmental Law Consumers Choice Council Defenders of Wildlife Earthjustice Friends of the Earth US National Wildlife Federation Institute for Agriculture Trade Policy and Sierra Club, (2002); Greening of World Trade Issues, (1992); Wto as an International Organization, (1998); Science on Trial the Clash of Medical Evidence and the Law in the Breast Implant Case, (1996); National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper no 6707 August 1998, (1998); International Trade Gatt and the Environment Wwf International, (1992); Arnoldi, Jakob, Niklas Luhmann: An Introduction, Theory, Culture and Society, 18, 1, pp. 1-13, (2001)",,Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.,,,1841133485; 9781847311016,,,English,Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957676654,

Increased use of energy carriers produced from domestic, renewable flows of energy is seen as an instrument to support objectives in these areas. The developments are supported by Europe-wide targets for a renewable share of primary energy, power generation, and renewable fuels, as well as policies, mostly at the national level. These reflect the fact that unguided energy markets cannot be expected to deliver on public goods. Also, such markets result in sub-optimal use of energy sources due to ""market"" and ""system"" failures. Renewable energy flows in Europe are large in comparison with commercial energy demand. Technologies exist to tap these flows, at costs that often are competitive if the evaluation includes external costs and benefits, and subsidies to conventional energy are eliminated. If renewable energy is to grow to a much larger fraction of energy supply, there must be a combination of efficient and effective policy instruments to reach the guiding objectives, an appropriate technical and regulatory infrastructure, clear and efficient administrative procedures, public acceptance, RD&D leading to innovation, new technologies entering the marketplace, and a cadre of professionals to design, build and operate renewable energy systems. This article examines these issues and policy options, against a background of renewable energy use varying considerably between countries in Europe, mostly owing to differences in policies for renewable energy. © 2004 International Energy Initiative, Inc. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Commerce; Energy Resources; Energy Security; Regional Planning; Renewable Energy Resources; Administrative Procedures; Commercial Energy Demand; Environmental Issues; Policy Instruments; Regional Development; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Systems; Renewable Energy Use; Energy Policy,Commerce; Energy resources; Energy security; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Administrative procedures; Commercial energy demand; Environmental issues; Policy instruments; Regional development; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Renewable energy use; Energy policy,,"An Evaluation of the European Context for A Transition Towards A Sustainable Energy System Council on Housing Spatial Planning and the Environment Vrom Raad and General Energy Council Algemene Energie Raad of the Netherlands, (2004); de Moor, André P.G., Towards a grand deal on subsidies and climate change, Natural Resources Forum, 25, 2, pp. 167-176, (2001); undefined; Environmental Governance in Europe, (2000); Renewable Energy Target for Europe 20 by 2020, (2004); Missing Targets how European Countries are Failing to Achieve Its Renewable Electricity Targets, (2004); Energy for the Future Renewable Sources of Energy, (1997); Directive 2001 77 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the Promotion of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources in the Internal Electricity Market, (2001); Draft Directive on the Promotion of Co Generation of Useful Heat and Electricity, (2002); Directive 2002 91 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Energy Performance of Buildings, (2002)",,Elsevier,,09730826; 23524669,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-14844357434,

The centres and the CP assessors trained by them do not deliver ready-made solutions, but rather they train and advise their clients on how to find the best solutions for specific problems. Two UNIDO evaluations of the programme confirm that the methodology for implementing the CP concept at the factory level is an effective tool for identification and prioritisation of technology changes that yield both environmental and financial benefits. However, the dissemination and application of the CP concept to small and medium size (SMEs) on the basis of its own financial merits does not occur easily; hence, there is a need to support the dissemination of the concept through promotional (awareness raising, training) activities, national policy formulation and access to financing. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The project document called for a joint programme between UNIDO and UNEP, with UNIDO acting as the executing agency and UNEP’s Industry and Environment Programme Activity Centre providing professional support (methodology and information). This Phase One document envisaged supporting eight to nine NCPCs for three years. 1 1 In February 1993, UNIDO and UNEP requested developing countries to apply, on the basis of guidelines issued by these two organizations, as host countries for NCPCs. The guidelines stated that an NCPC could be located in industrial trade associations, chambers of commerce and industry, industrial productivity centres, universities or other industry-oriented organizations. UNIDO received applications from 39 institutions in 25 countries on the closure date of October 1993. In November 1993, an expert panel selected nine institutions/countries based primarily on the strength of the host institution and qualifications of the potential head of the centre (called the Cleaner Production Promoter) and taking into account regional distribution. UNIDO and UNEP undertook field visits to the semi-finalists in mid-1994 and announced the five finalists (China, India, Mexico, Tanzania and Zimbabwe) for the programme in November 1994. In addition, Brazil was selected conditionally based on the availability of funds, both its own and those from UNIDO and UNEP. In 1994, UNIDO also proposed centres and found funding from Austria for NCPCs in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Officially, the NCPC programme started for the seven centres in January 1995 with Brazil joining in June 1995 on the basis of a self-financed trust fund. Collectively in this article, these eight centres are referred to as the “old” NCPCs.; Funding text 2: Even though it is difficult to get a clear picture about the current level of cost recovery by NCPC programme components, it is clear that without external support (by foreign donors), the NCPCs could hardly survive. Those NCPCs, which are likely to sustain their operations after completion of the UNIDO financial support (China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Slovakia, the Czech centre, Zimbabwe, Tanzania etc.), either enjoy support of the host institution or have managed to access other external funding sources (usually other CP programmes). Some of them earn some income on services sold to the government when supporting them in the design and implementation of their environmental programmes.","Agenda, (1997); Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, (2002); In Depth Evaluation of Selected Unido Activities on Development and Transfer of Technology, (1999); Evaluation of the National Cleaner Production Centres in Central Europe, (2001); Evaluation of the Unido Unep National Cleaner Production Centre Programme, (1996); Comparative Analysis of Cleaner Production Centres, (1998); Muchie, Mammo, Old wine in new bottles: A critical exploration of the UN's conceptions and mechanisms for the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to industry, Technology in Society, 22, 2, pp. 201-220, (2000); Learning from the Experience of National Cleaner Production Centres, (2002); Proceedings of the Conference on Ecological Sustainable Industrial Development Copenhagen, (1991); Facility Pollution Prevention Guide, (1992)",,Elsevier Ltd,,09596526,,JCROE,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242304260,

This is commonly referred to as socially responsible investment (SRI). The growth in SRI over the last five years has been impressive but research conducted both in Australia and overseas suggests that investment professionals do not place the same importance on environmental performance as other stakeholders. Our objective was to develop an improved understanding of why environmental performance information does not feature to any great extent in investment decision-making. In-depth interviews with investment professionals in Australia indicate that the explanations lie in the perceptions of the relationship between environmental and financial performance, the absence of reliable information on environmental performance, and a lack of knowledge about how environmental and financial performance can be compared in a meaningful way. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Investment; Savings Behavior; Sustainability; Australia,investment; savings behavior; sustainability; Australia,,"Uncovering Value Integrating Environmental and Financial Performance, (1998); Australian Stock Exchange Fact Book 2000, (2000); United Nations Environment Programme Financial Services Initiative Conference, (2000); City Analysts and the Environment, (1994); Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value, (1997); Pensions Management, (2000); Unep Fi Quarterly 1, (2001); Coffey, Betty S., Institutional ownership of stock and dimensions of corporate social performance: An empirical examination, Journal of Business Ethics, 10, 6, pp. 437-444, (1991); Does the City have A Social Conscience, (2000); Reuters News Service, (2000)",,Greenleaf Publishing,,09669671,,,,English,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035206884,
